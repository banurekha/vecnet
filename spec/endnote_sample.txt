%X The Plasmodium falciparum rate was determined by microscopical examination of one salivary gland (three lobes) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of the other salivary gland in each of 1580 Anopheles mosquitoes collected from western Kenya during both the wet and dry seasons. The sporozoite rate in the wet season was much higher than that in the dry season, and the sporozoite rate determined by ELISA was generally lower than that determined by microscopy. The ELISA gave a positive reaction to circumsporozoite protein in some glands whose counterparts did not show the presence of sporozoites by microscopy, thus giving an 'overestimation' of the sporozoite rate. This overestimation was greater in the dry season than in the wet season, and greater in Anopheles gambiae than in An. funestus, but overall it was only 1.2% (19/1580). These results are at variance with reports of other workers, who have shown ELISA overestimation of the sporozoite rate as high as 30%. Our tests indicated that the ELISA sensitivity was 80.6%, its specificity was 98.7%, and its accuracy was 97.5%.

%! Deforestation and vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae Giles mosquitoes in malaria transmission, Kenya
%X We investigated the effects of deforestation on microclimates and sporogonic development of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in an area of the western Kenyan highland prone to malaria epidemics. An. gambiae mosquitoes were fed with P. falciparum–infected blood through membrane feeders. Fed mosquitoes were placed in houses in forested and deforested areas in a highland area (1,500 m above sea level) and monitored for parasite development. Deforested sites had higher temperatures and relative humidities, and the overall infection rate of mosquitoes was increased compared with that in forested sites. Sporozoites appeared on average 1.1 days earlier in deforested areas. Vectorial capacity was estimated to be 77.7% higher in the deforested site than in the forested site. We showed that deforestation changes microclimates, leading to more rapid sporogonic development of P. falciparum and to a marked increase of malaria risk in the western Kenyan highland.

%X Studies were carried out at a malaria epidemic-prone highland site in western Kenya to determine the effects of deforestation-caused microclimate change on the duration of the gonotrophic cycle of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles. Gonotrophic cycle duration was measured using field-collected F1 A. gambiae females. Average ambient temperature in the deforested area of Kakamega (elevation 1,430-1,580 m above sea level), western Kenya, was 0.5 degrees C higher than that of the forested area over a 10-mo period. During the dry season, deforested areas showed an increased mean indoor temperature of 1.8 degrees C, and a shortened duration of the mosquitoes' first and second gonotrophic cycles, by 1.7 d (59%) and 0.9 d (43%). During the rainy season, the average indoor temperature of houses located in the deforested area was 1.2 degrees C higher than in houses in the forested area. The duration of the first and second gonotrophic cycles was shortened by 1.5 d (17%) and 1.4 d (27%), respectively, in the deforested highland site. A shorter mosquito gonotrophic cycle implies increased daily biting frequency and thus increased vectorial capacity. Together with evidence that deforestation reduced A. gambiae larva-to-adult developmental time and increased larval and adult survivorship, this study suggests that deforestation can further enhance malaria transmission potential in the highlands through increased indoor temperature and shortened gonotrophic cycle durations of A. gambiae mosquitoes.

%! Effects of microclimatic changes caused by deforestation on the survivorship and reproductive fitness of Anopheles gambiae in western Kenya highlands
%X Land use changes have been suggested as one of the causes for malaria epidemics in the African highlands. This study investigated the effects of deforestation-induced changes in indoor temperature on the survivorship and reproductive fitness of Anopheles gambiae in an epidemic prone area in the western Kenya highlands. We found that the mean indoor temperatures of houses located in the deforested area were 1.2°C higher than in houses located in the forested area during the dry season and 0.7°C higher during the rainy season. The mosquito mortality rate was highly age-dependent regardless of study site or season. Mosquitoes that were placed in houses in the deforested area showed a 64.8–79.5% higher fecundity than those in houses located in the forested area, but the median survival time was reduced by 5–7 days. Female mosquitoes in the deforested area showed a 38.5–40.6% increase in net reproductive rate and an 11.6–42.9% increase in intrinsic growth rate than those in the forested area. Significant increases in net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate for mosquitoes in the deforested area suggest that deforestation enhances mosquito reproductive fitness, increasing mosquito population growth potential in the western Kenya highlands. The vectorial capacity of An. gambiae under study was estimated at least 106% and 29% higher in the deforested area than in the forested area in dry and rainy seasons, respectively.

%X In high-elevation areas in western Kenya, the abundance of Anopheles arabiensis is either very low or absent. The western Kenya highlands (an area with an elevation > 1,500m above sea level) have also been experiencing extensive deforestation, and deforestation has been suggested as one of the important factors that facilitate malaria transmission in the highlands. This study investigated whether climate conditions in the western Kenya highlands (Kakamega, elevation 1,500 m above sea level) were permissive to the development and survival of An. arabiensis and whether deforestation promoted An. arabiensis survivorship of immature and adult stages, using life-table analysis. We found that in larval habitats located in forested areas, only 4-9% of first-instar larvae developed into adults and the development length exceeded 20 days. Mean water temperature of aquatic habitats in the deforested area was 4.8-6.1 degrees C higher than that in the forested area, larval-to-adult survivorship was increased to 65-82%, and larval-to-adult development time was shortened by 8-9 days. The average indoor temperature in houses in the deforested area was 1.7-1.8 degrees C higher than in the forested area, and the relative humidity was 22-25% lower. The median survival time of adult mosquitoes in the deforested area was 49-55% higher than those in the forested area. The net reproductive rate of female mosquitoes in the deforested area was 1.7- to 2.6-fold higher than that in the forested area. Compared with previously published data on An. gambiae, the net reproductive rate of An. arabiensis was only 0.8-1.3% of Anopheles gambiae in the forested area and 2.3-2.6% in the deforested area. Therefore, the current ambient climate condition is less permissive to An. arabiensis than to An. gambiae in western Kenya highlands. However, environmental changes such as deforestation and global warming may facilitate the establishment of An. arabiensis populations in the highlands.

%X A polymorphism in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene, with a guanine to adenine nucleotide change at position –308, TNF2 is associated with increased TNF-α production. TNF2 homozygotes have a higher risk of severe disease and/or death due to cerebral malaria and other infectious diseases. We investigated the impact of this allele on malaria morbidity and mortality in young children who participated in an immuno-epidemiologic cohort study of malaria in an area of intense perennial Plasmodium falciparum transmission in western Kenya. A total of 1,048 children were genotyped. Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the relationship between TNF-308 variants and morbidity and mortality. The gene frequencies of the TNF1 and TNF2 alleles were 0.90 and 0.10, respectively. TNF2 homozygosity was associated with pre-term birth when compared with TNF1 homozygotes [relative risk (RR) 7.3, 95% CI, 2.85–18.9, P = 0.002) and heterozygotes (RR 6.7, 95% CI 2.0–23.0, P = 0.008). Among children born prematurely, the TNF2 allele was significantly associated with a higher risk of death in infancy compared with TNF1 (RR 7.47, 95% CI 2.36–23.6). The risk of death was higher among TNF2 homozygotes than among heterozygotes. The TNF2 allele was significantly associated with high density P. falciparum parasitemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.0–1.24). Among low birth weight children, the TNF2 allele was associated with severe anemia (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.17–4.01) and showed a trend toward a risk for severe malaria anemia (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.89–4.46). These data suggest that TNF2 is a risk factor for pre-term birth and early childhood mortality and malaria morbidity in children in this region. Further understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this association is required. Genet. Epidemiol. 21:201–211, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

%X Summary The high frequency of the sickle-cell haemoglobin (HbS) gene in malaria endemic regions is believed to be due to a heterozygote (HbASp) advantage against fatal malaria. Data to prospectively confirm the protection associated with HbAS against mortality are lacking. We show that HbAS provides significant protection against all-cause mortality, severe malarial anaemia, and high-density parasitaemia. This significant reduction in mortality was detected between the ages of 2 and 16 months, the highest risk period for severe malarial anaemia in this area. These data are important in understanding the role of malaria in the selection and maintenance of the sickle cell gene.

%! Factors affecting use of permethrin-treated bed nets during a randomized controlled trial in western Kenya
%X Adherence with permethrin-treated bed net (ITN) use and their proper deployment was directly observed in 2,178 individuals (784 households) participating in a large-scale trial of ITNs on child mortality in western Kenya. The ITNs were distributed free of charge to ensure high coverage, resulting in a ratio of 1.46 persons per ITN. Approximately 30% of ITNs present were unused. The overall percentage adherence was 72.3%. The probability of adherence by individuals depended strongly on age (relative risk [RR] = 0.86, 95% confidence limit [CL] − 0.78–0.94), in which children less than five years of age were less likely to use ITNs than older individuals, and temperature, in which ITNs were more likely to be used in periods of cooler weather. A marginally significant diminution in adherence during the second year of the project was also observed (RR = 0.83, 95% CL = 0.68–1.01). Mosquito numbers, relative wealth, number of house occupants, and the educational level of the head of the household had no effect on adherence. In unstructured questioning of house residents, excessive heat was often cited as a reason for not deploying the child’s ITN. The most important reason for non-adherence was disruption of sleeping arrangements, indicating that ITNs were not readily redeployed in the face of shifting sleeping patterns due to visitors, funerals, house construction, and other events. Challenges faced by health education programs to maximize adherence with ITN use are discussed.

%! Perceptions of bed nets and malaria prevention before and after a randomized controlled trial of permethrin-treated bed nets in western Kenya
%X A study of mothers’ perceptions regarding bed nets and malaria was conducted before and after a randomized controlled trial of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) in western Kenya. Awareness about the trial and the rationale for bed net use increased by the end of the trial. Knowledge that mosquitoes caused malaria also increased; however, a higher proportion of mothers from control, rather than intervention villages, cited this (44.4% versus 27.9%; P < 0.001). Mothers from intervention villages were more knowledgeable about the use and maintenance of bed nets and re-treatment with insecticide. Both groups specified advantages of ITNs. Mothers from intervention villages noted practical advantages such as protection against bedbugs and falling roof debris. Few (< 1%) mothers indicated that ITNs protected children against malaria. Intervention homes used significantly fewer mosquito coils, insect spray, medicines, and burned cow dung less often compared with those in control villages. Mothers were willing to pay approximately U.S. $ 4.5 for a regular bed net, but only U.S. 10.5 cents (intervention) and 0.036 (control) for re-treating a bed net. This study suggests that, despite two years of experience of use, bed nets and insecticides would not be purchased as a household priority in this impoverished rural community.

%! Community reactions to the introduction of permethrin-treated bed nets for malaria control during a randomized controlled trial in western Kenya
%X Prior to implementation of a randomized controlled trial of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) in western Kenya, ethnographic studies were conducted to understand local perceptions of disease, sleeping patterns, and other factors that might affect use of ITNs. Educational activities took place prior to distribution, but immediately after distribution in Asembo only approximately half of the ITNs were in use. A qualitative study was then conducted to identify the community’s perceptions about ITNs and the ITN project. While participants ranked malaria as important and recognized that malaria prevention could be beneficial, they believed ITNs would be only partly effective due to the perception that malaria has multiple causes. Concerns expressed included fear of the insecticide, thought by some to be a toxic family planning aid, the taking of blood during clinical studies, and the mixing up of family ITNs during net re-treatment, which would violate cultural taboos. Attempts were made to allay fears by improved communication on these subjects and modification of the study design.

%X BACKGROUND:Understanding the impact of reducing Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission requires estimates of the relationship between health outcomes and exposure to infectious mosquitoes. However, measures of exposure such as mosquito density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) are generally aggregated over large areas and time periods, biasing the outcome-exposure relationship. There are few studies examining the extent and drivers of local variation in malaria exposure in endemic areas.METHODS:We describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of malaria transmission intensity measured by mosquito density and EIR in the KEMRI/CDC health and demographic surveillance system using entomological data collected during 2002-2004. Geostatistical zero inflated binomial and negative binomial models were applied to obtain location specific (house) estimates of sporozoite rates and mosquito densities respectively. Model-based predictions were multiplied to estimate the spatial pattern of annual entomological inoculation rate, a measure of the number of infective bites a person receive per unit of time. The models included environmental and climatic predictors extracted from satellite data, harmonic seasonal trends and parameters describing space-time correlation.RESULTS:Anopheles gambiae s.l was the main vector species accounting for 86% (n=2309) of the total collected mosquitoes with the remainder being Anopheles funestus. Sixty eight percent (757/1110) of the surveyed houses had no mosquitoes. Distance to water bodies, vegetation and day temperature were significantly associated with mosquito density. Overall annual point estimates of EIR were 6.7, 9.3 and 9.6 infectious bites per annum for 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Monthly mosquito density and EIR varied over the study period peaking in May during the wet season. The predicted and observed densities and EIR showed a strong seasonal and spatial pattern over the study area.CONCLUSIONS:Spatio-temporal maps of malaria transmission intensity obtained in this study are not only useful in understanding variability in malaria epidemiology over small areas but also provides a high resolution exposure surface that can be used to analyse the impact of malaria exposure on mortality.

%X We investigated patterns of genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum associated with its two main African vectors: Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus. We dissected 10,296 wild-caught mosquitoes from three tropical sites, two in Cameroon (Simbock and Tibati, separated by 320 km) and one in Kenya (Rota, > 2,000 km from the other two sites). We assayed seven microsatellite loci in 746 oocysts from 183 infected mosquito guts. Genetic polymorphism was very high in parasites isolated from both vector species. The expected heterozygosity (H-E) was 0.79 in both species; the observed heterozygosities (H-O) were 0.32 in A. funestus and 0.42 in A. gambiae, indicating considerable inbreeding within both vector species. Mean selfing (s) between genetically identical gametes was s = 0.33. Differences in the rate of inbreeding were statistically insignificant among sites and between the two vector species. As expected, because of the high rate of inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium was very high; it was significant for all 21 loci pairs in A. gambiae and for 15 of 21 pairs in A. funestus, although only two pairwise comparisons were between loci on the same chromosome. Overall, the genetic population structure of A falciparum, as evaluated by F statistics, was predominantly clonal rather than panmictic, a population structure that facilitates the spread of antimalarial drug and vaccine resistance and thus may impair the effectiveness of malaria control efforts.

%! Comparison of government statistics and demographic surveillance to monitor mortality in children less than five years old in rural western Kenya
%X Estimates of mortality in children less than five years old using government civil registration statistics (passive surveillance) were compared against statistics generated by active demographic surveillance during a randomized controlled trial of permethrin-treated bed nets (ITNs) in western Kenya. Mortality rates were two-fold lower when estimated through civil registration compared with active prospective surveillance (rate ratio [RR] = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44–0.59). While civil registration underestimated deaths, particularly in the neonatal period, the age distribution of deaths in children 1–59 months of age was the same as with active surveillance. Seasonal mortality trends were also similar. There was no agreement between cause of death recorded by active and passive surveillance. Verbal autopsy estimated that half of all deaths were associated with malaria and pneumonia, but civil registration markedly under-reported these illnesses; incidence RR (95% CI) = 0.18 (0.14–0.24), and 0.05 (0.03–0.08), respectively, while over-reporting deaths due to measles (RR = 15.5 [95% CI = 7.3–33.2]). Government statistics under-represent mortality, particularly neonatal mortality, in children less than five years of age in rural areas of Kenya. They can provide accurate information on the age-distribution of deaths among children 1–59 months old, and on seasonal trends, but not on disease-specific mortality.

%X ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets in Asembo and low coverage in Seme, two adjacent communities in western Nyanza Province, Kenya; followed by expanded coverage of bed nets in Seme, as the Kenya national malaria programme rolled out; provided a natural experiment for quantification of changes in relative abundance of two primary malaria vectors in this holoendemic region. Both belong to the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) species complex, namely A. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles arabiensis. Historically, the former species was proportionately dominant in indoor resting collections of females. METHODS: Data of the relative abundance of adult A. gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis sampled from inside houses were obtained from the literature from 1970 to 2002 for sites west of Kisumu, Kenya, to the region of Asembo ca. 50 km from the city. A sampling transect was established from Asembo (where bed net use was high due to presence of a managed bed net distribution programme) eastward to Seme, where no bed net programme was in place. Adults of A. gambiae s.l. were sampled from inside houses along the transect from 2003 to 2009, as were larvae from nearby aquatic habitats, providing data over a nearly 40 year period of the relative abundance of the two species. Relative proportions of A. gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis were determined for each stage by identifying species by the polymerase chain reaction method. Household bed net ownership was measured with surveys during mosquito collections. Data of blood host choice, parity rate, and infection rate for Plasmodium falciparum in A. gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis were obtained for a sample from Asembo and Seme from 2005. RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae s.s. adult females from indoor collections predominated from 1970 to 1998 (ca. 85%). Beginning in 1999, A. gambiae s.s decreased proportionately relative to A. arabiensis, then precipitously declined to rarity coincident with increased bed net ownership as national bed net distribution programmes commenced in 2004 and 2006. By 2009, A. gambiae s.s. comprised proportionately ca. 1% of indoor collections and A. arabiensis 99%. In Seme compared to Asembo in 2003, proportionately more larvae were A. gambiae s.s., larval density was higher, and more larval habitats were occupied. As bed net use rose in Seme, the proportion of A. gambiae larvae declined as well. These trends continued to 2009. Parity and malaria infection rates were lower in both species in Asembo (high bed net use) compared to Seme (low bed net use), but host choice did not vary within species in both communities (predominantly cattle for A. arabiensis, humans for A. gambiae s.s.). CONCLUSIONS: A marked decline of the A. gambiae s.s. population occurred as household ownership of bed nets rose in a region of western Kenya over a 10 year period. The increased bed net coverage likely caused a mass effect on the composition of the A. gambiae s.l. species complex, resulting in the observed proportionate increase in A. arabiensis compared to its closely related sibling species, A. gambiae s.s. These observations are important in evaluating the process of regional malaria elimination, which requires sustained vector control as a primary intervention.

%X Natural blood-feeding and sugar-feeding behaviors were investigated for populations of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus Giles at 2 sites in western Kenya. During peak levels of malaria parasite transmission, > 85% of 1,569 indoor-resting females contained fresh blood meals. Findings that up to 55.4% of blood-fed resting females and 72.0% of host-seeking females had either stage IV or V oocytes provided strong evidence that females were refeeding before oviposition. Such gonotrophic discordance was common throughout the year for both An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus. Determinations of gonotrophic cycles for freshly blood-fed mosquitoes collected inside houses indicated that only 60.0% of 1,287 An. gambiae s.l. and 60.0% of 974 An. funestus oviposited eggs after a single blood meal. The timing of oviposition was irregular as indicated by relatively high coefficients of variation for An. gambiae s.l. (44.0%) and An. funestus (35.9%). Associated with frequent blood feeding was a surprisingly low rate of sugar feeding; only 6.3% of 1,183 indoor-resting and only 14.4% of 236 host-seeking anophelines were positive for fructose. Natural patterns of frequent blood feeding, year-round gonotrophic discordance, irregular oviposition cycles, and limited sugar feeding illustrate that anopheline mosquitoes have complex behavioral and physiologic means for adapting to their environment. In western Kenya, for example, adaptations for frequent blood feeding by An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus potentiates their ability to transmit malaria parasites, well beyond that predicted by standard measures of vectorial capacity.

%X The potential for Anopheles egg survival in dry soil from larval development sites was investigated in western Kenya. A total of 230 dry soil samples collected in 1987, 1988 and 1989 yielded 126 first-instar Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae from 2 to 5 days after flooding with water. These larvae were from dried animal hoofprints along streams (57.9%), from dried edges of permanent and temporary pools (41.3%) and from dried stream beds (0.8%). Larval density was 1.2 larvae/kg of soil from positive microhabitats in 1987 and 2.4 larvae/kg in 1988. Thirteen larvae from the 1989 soil samples, reared to adults, were identified by DNA probes as Anopheles gambiae sensu strictu (n = 6) and Anopheles arabiensis (n = 7). Experimentally, eggs from field-collected females remained viable up to 12 days for An. gambiae s.l. and 10 days for An. funestus. In western Kenya, egg viability in dry soil may represent a significant, short-term survival mechanism for 2 species of the An. gambiae complex.

%X Anopheles gambiae s.1. and An. funestus were sampled for Plasmodium spp. ookinetes in two P. falciparum-endemic sites in western Kenya. Since the ookinete is a transitional stage of short duration, occurring after fertilization and before oocyst development, only females in the half-gravid and gravid stages of blood digestion were examined. Preparations of homogenized midguts were spotted onto microslides and examined microscopically after staining with Giemsa. Overall, ookinetes were detected in 4.4% of 1,079 anophelines examined over an eight-month period. Anopheles funestus had higher ookinete rates than An. gambiae s.1., and ookinete rates were higher in half-gravid than in gravid An. gambiae s.1. Geometric mean numbers of ookinetes per infected female were less than five for each species at the two sites, and the maximum number observed was only 12. The low frequencies and numbers of ookinetes were sufficient to produce sporozoite rates of 4-18% in the vector populations. The intense transmission of P. falciparum in these two sites is maintained by anthropophilic vectors where only one in 23 blood meals initiates an infection of generally less than five ookinetes. Relationships between human malaria infectiousness and vector infectivity are dependent upon the high efficiency of the developmental transition from the ookinete to the subsequent oocyst and sporozoite stages.

%X This study tested the feasibility of identifying salavary gland sporozoites to species by Plasmodium falciparum ELISA by drying them on slides or in vials. The glands were dissected from Anopheles gambiae Giles s.l. and An. funestus Giles collected in western Kenya. In 119 gland infections containing a geometric mean of 1,222 sporozoites, a mean of 72.5% of sporozoites were removed in 60 microliters saline from slides at the time of dissection. Each of the 119 samples was divided into three 18 microliters aliquots. Subsamples were stored at -70 degrees C, dried in vials, or dried on a microslide. When tested by Plasmodium falciparum ELISA, positive reactions were observed in 86.6% of frozen samples, 70.6% of samples held dry in vials, and 50.4% of samples held dry on microslides for 1 mo. Of 90 gland infections where coverslips were removed and slides were left to dry for 1 mo before adding blocking buffer, 81.1% were positive for P. falciparum. This was not significantly different from either frozen gland samples (where 85.5% of 392 infections were identified or frozen gland plus corresponding thorax samples where 86.2% of 160 samples were identified). In malaria field studies, where it is not always practical to freeze samples, sporozoites from dissected mosquitoes can be preserved adequately for ELISA identification by simply removing coverslips and drying dissection slides.

%X The malaria transmission potential of wild, infective Anopheles from western Kenya was evaluated by determining the number of sporozoites transmitted in vitro by salivation when their mouthparts were inserted into capillary tubes containing either sucrose or blood. With sucrose, 86.6% of 102 infective Anopheles transmitted a geometric mean (GM) of 3.84 sporozoites (range 1-34). With blood, 23.1% of 104 infective Anopheles, tested on the day of collection, transmitted a GM of 2.30 sporozoites (range 1-117). For Anopheles held 5 days postcapture before testing with blood, 53.6% of 56 transmitted a GM of 6.04 sporozoites (range 1-420). Transmitting Anopheles contained significantly more salivary gland sporozoites than non-transmitters. No significant differences were detected between Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato and Anopheles funestus Giles in sporozoite transmission by individuals with sporozoites in their salivary glands. Sporozoites were detected microscopically in the salivary duct from heads in 80.3% of 117 infective Anopheles (GM = 11.2, range 1-71). Sporozoite detection in mosquito heads by ELISA was 25% less efficient than microscopic detection. Over 98% of the infective Anopheles transmitted less than twenty-five Over 98% of the infective Anopheles transmitted less than twenty-five sporozoites. Transmitted sporozoites represented only about 3% of the total sporozoites in the salivary glands suggesting that sporozoite transmission may be restricted to sporozoites in the salivary duct at the time of feeding. Results are discussed in relation to anti-sporozoite vaccine development.

%X The number of malaria sporozoites in the salivary glands was determined microscopically for 1137 wild, naturally infected Anopheles from western Kenya. Infective Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato (n = 874) contained a geometric mean (GM) of 962 sporozoites and An.funestus Giles (n = 263) contained 812. No significant differences were detected in geometric mean numbers of sporozoites between species, collection techniques or sites. Of the infective An.gambiae, 1.7% (15/874) contained more than 41,830 sporozoites, the maximum observed for An.funestus. Microscopic techniques were found to be more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detecting low-grade sporozoite infections in salivary glands. Salivary gland sporozoites from 83.6% of the 1137 gland infections were identified by ELISA as either Plasmodium falciparum Welch (n = 910), P.ovale Stephens (n = 7), P.malariae Grassi & Feletti (n = 3) or mixed (n = 30). The 187 gland infections which could not be identified by ELISA contained significantly fewer sporozoites (GM = 242) than those which could be identified (GM = 1200).

%X Human circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum were detected in blood meals from 45.0% of 1,547 field-collected Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato and Anopheles funestus Giles from western Kenya. Possible effects on malaria infections within the Anopheles host were investigated. Circumsporozoite antibodies were detected in blood meals up to 36 h after feeding. Antibodies crossing the midgut were detected experimentally in hemolymph from 4 to 36 h after feeding; human IgG also was present in hemolymph from fully gravid field-collected Anopheles. Ingestion of high-titer human CS antibodies or 2A10 monoclonal antibody to P. falciparum sporozoites by P. falciparum-infected An. gambiae, 10 d after feeding on an infected human, had no effect on oocyst maturation, sporozoite rates, or sporozoite loads. Contact between CS antibodies and sporozoites in the hemocoel did not block sporozoite invasion of salivary glands. Human IgG antibodies were detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique on salivary gland sporozoites from 83.3% of 114 field-collected Anopheles. In 65.4% of 26 infections, antibodies persisted on sporozoites for at least three days. Thus, a high proportion of naturally infected An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus in western Kenya transmit sporozoites that are bound with human IgG acquired during previous blood meals. The infectivity of such sporozoites needs to be determined in relation to natural transmission and to the potential use of malaria sporozoite vaccines.

%X Relationships between Plasmodium falciparum incidence and entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs) were determined for a 21-month period in Saradidi, western Kenya, in preparation for malaria vaccine field trials. Children, ranging in age from six months to six years and treated to clear malaria parasites, were monitored daily for up to 12 weeks to detect new malaria infections. Overall, new P. falciparum infections were detected in 77% of 809 children. The percentage of children that developed infections per two-week period averaged 34.7%, ranging from 7.3% to 90.9%. Transmission by vector populations was detected in 86.4% (38 of 44) of the two-week periods, with daily EIRs averaging 0.75 infective bites per person. Periods of intense transmission during April to August, and from November to January, coincided with seasonal rains. Relationships between daily malaria attack rates and EIRs indicated that an average of only 7.5% (1 in 13) of the sporozoite inoculations produced new infections in children. Regression analysis demonstrated that EIRs accounted for 74% of the variation in attack rates. One of the components of the EIR, the human-biting rate, alone accounted for 68% of the variation in attack rates. Thus, measurements of either the EIR or the human-biting rate can be used to predict corresponding attack rates in children. These baseline epidemiologic studies indicate that the intense transmission patterns of P. falciparum in Saradidi will provide excellent conditions for evaluating malaria vaccine efficacy.

%X An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a repetitive epitope on the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum was used in Kenya to assess malaria infections in Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus. The ELISA confirmed that 88% of 44 sporozoite-positive gland dissections were P. falciparum. The ELISA infection rate of 18.6% (n = 736) for individually tested mosquitoes for both species was significantly higher than the 10.4% (n = 537) salivary gland sporozoite rate determined by dissection. This difference was due to ELISA detection of medium and large sized oocysts on the midguts of infected mosquitoes which did not contain salivary gland sporozoites. From a series of 379 Anopheles that were cut at the thorax, ELISA tests on "head" and "body" portions showed that 29.5% of 95 positive mosquitoes contained circumsporozoite antigen in the body portion in the absence of salivary gland infections. This field evaluation demonstrates that the ELISA can most accurately be used to estimate sporozoite rates by cutting mosquitoes at the thorax and testing anterior portions.

%X Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the circumsporozoite (CS) antigens of Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale were used to identify species of sporozoite and oocyst infections detected by dissection in Anopheles gambiae s.1. and An. funestus collected in western Kenya. ELISAs identified 92.5% of 1,113 salivary gland infections; Plasmodium species infections included 79.4% P. falciparum, 3.2% P. malariae, 1.7% P. ovale, and 2 or more Plasmodium species were detected in 15.7% of the Anopheles in which the species of parasite was identified. Identification was more likely with greater numbers of sporozoites observed in dissections, increasing from 65% ELISA positivity in mosquitoes with 1-10 sporozoites in their salivary glands to 96% in mosquitoes with over 1,000 sporozoites. ELISAs detected CS antigen in 66% of 294 Anopheles that by dissection had oocysts but uninfected salivary glands. Of 112 Anopheles with a single species of Plasmodium detected in the salivary glands, 29 (25.9%) had 1 or more additional species detected in the midgut, indicating a high potential for multiple infections. Similar proportions of Plasmodium species were found in An. gambiae s.1. and An. funestus.

Variation (Genetics)
%X Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis are mosquito species responsible for most malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. They are also closely related sibling species that share chromosomal and molecular polymorphisms as a consequence of incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization. To help resolve these processes, this study examined the partitioning of mtDNA sequence variation within and between species across Africa, from both population genetic and phylogeographic perspectives. Based on partial gene sequences from the cytochrome b, ND1 and ND5 genes, haplotype diversity was high but sequences were very closely related. Within species, little or no population subdivision was detected, and there was no evidence for isolation by distance. Between species, there were no fixed nucleotide differences, a high proportion of shared polymorphisms, and eight haplotypes in common over distances as great as 6000 km. Only one of 16 shared polymorphisms led to an amino acid difference, and there was no compelling evidence for nonneutral variation. Parsimony networks constructed of haplotypes from both species revealed no correspondence of haplotype with either geography or taxonomy. This trend of low intraspecific genetic divergence is consistent with evidence from allozyme and microsatellite data and is interpreted in terms of both extensive gene flow and recent range expansion from relatively large, stable populations. We argue that retention of ancestral polymorphisms is a plausible but insufficient explanation for low interspecific genetic divergence, and that extensive hybridization is a contributing factor.

%! Longitudinal cohort study of the epidemiology of malaria infections in an area of intense malaria transmission I. Description of study site, general methodology, and study population
%X A large-scale longitudinal cohort project was initiated in western Kenya in June 1992. The primary purpose of the project was to study Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a highly endemic area using a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, which included epidemiology, entomology, and immunology. Between June 1992 and July 1994, pregnant women living in 15 rural villages were identified during a monthly census and 1,164 were enrolled. The women were followed-up throughout their pregnancy and they, along with their newborn infants and direct siblings of the infants' less than 15 years of age, were monitored over time. As of May 1995, 1,017 infants had been born to these women. This paper presents the design and general methodology used in this study and describes the initial experience with intense monitoring of a large population over a prolonged period.

%X Anopheles funestus Giles is a major malaria vector in Africa, but little is known about the genetic structure of natural populations. In this study, microsatellite markers were used to investigate the genetic structure of A. funestus populations from Kenya. Two populations from western Kenya 80 km apart and two from coastal Kenya 50 km apart were collected and examined for allelic variation at five trinucleotide microsatellite loci. We found A. funestus Giles was the predominant species (> 98%) in the A. funestus group in these populations. The western Kenya populations exhibited higher genetic diversity than the coastal populations. No significant genetic structure for populations within the coastal or western Kenya regions was detected. However, population genetic differentiation between the two regions was high (F(ST) = 0.208, R(ST) = 0.158), approximately two-fold higher than A. gambiae populations from the same area. The results suggest that the minimum area associated with a deme of A. funestus in western or coastal Kenya is larger than 50 km in diameter. The Great Rift Valley in east Africa, high-elevation mountains in western Kenya, and the vast arid area east to the Great Rift Valley may all play a role in restricting A. funestus gene flow between coastal and western Kenya.

%R 10.1086/315424
%X The anti—merozoite surface protein—1 19-kDa IgG (anti-MSP119KD) IgG responses of 33 parasitemic infants, aged 6–14 months, were compared with those of their mothers at the time of the infant's delivery and at the time the infants were sampled; the antimalaria protection associated with these responses was also compared. IgG1 and IgG3 were the predominant subclasses. Infants <300 days old and pregnant mothers had the lowest cytophilic-to-noncytophilic IgG ratio. By 300 days of age, the infants had IgG subclass compositions and levels similar to those of their mothers at the same date. Among infants, older infants with only 1 or 2 detected asexual parasitemias had the highest cytophilic-to-noncytophilic IgG ratio and IgG1 levels. IgG1 level was negatively correlated with protection. The findings suggest that the MSP119KD antibody response develops with age, not with multiple experiences with parasitemia, and, thus, that an antimalaria vaccine strategy for pregnant mothers could delay infants' first parasitemias until they are more capable of mounting a favorable anti-MSPl19KD response.

%X To assess the relationship between the within-host diversity of malaria infections and the susceptibility of the host to subsequent infection, we genotyped 60 children's successive infections from birth through 3 years of life. MSP-1 Block2 genotypes were used to estimate the complexity of infection (COI). Malaria transmission and age were positively associated with the number of K1 and Mad20 alleles detected (COIKM) (P < 0.003). Controlling for previous parasitemia, transmission, drug treatment, parasite density, sickle cell, and age, COIKM was negatively correlated with resistance to parasitemia of >500/μl (P < 0.0001). Parasitemias with the RO-genotype were more resistant than those without this genotype (P < 0.0000). The resistance in low COIKM infections was not genotype specific. We discuss the impact of genotype-transcending immunity to conserved antigenic determinants. We also propose a diversity-driven immunomodulation hypothesis that may explain the delayed development of natural immunity in the first few years of life and suggest that interventions that decrease the COIKM could facilitate the development of protective immunity.

%X A recently developed DNA probe method was compared with the standard
cytogenetic method for identifying the species of individual mosquitoes in the Anopheles
gambiae complex. The complex consists of 6 morphologically indistinguishable sibling
species that include the major African malaria vectors. Haif-gravid, field collected mos
quitoes were split into 2 portions: the abdomen was preserved for ovarian nurse cell
cytotaxonomy and the head/thorax portion was desiccated for DNA extraction. Cytogenetic
examination of the Kenya specimens showed 88 An. gambiae and 108 An. arabiensis. The
Zimbabwe specimens consisted of 6 An. gambiae and 55 An. quadriannulatus. All samples
of the 3 species were polymorphic for the major chromosomal inversions previously re
corded in field specimens from eastern and southern Africa, indicating that the collections
reflected natural levels of intraspecific variation in the field populations sampled. Approx
imately 97% of the cytologically identified mosquitoes were also identified to species by
the DNA probe method, and in every case the DNA probe and cytogenetic methods of
speciesidentificatipornoduced concordantresults.

%X Human IgG antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages, gametocytes and sporozoites were detected by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques in the blood meals of Anopheles gambiae s.l. from a malaria-endemic area of western Kenya. Field-collected mosquitoes, which had been stored dry for over 2 years, were screened first for human IgG by ELISA. In 141 blood meal samples from human-fed mosquitoes, the prevalence of stage-specific antibodies was 87.9% for asexual-stage parasites, 78.0% for gametocytes, and 87.9% for sporozoites. There were no differences in the prevalence of stage-specific antibodies for mosquitoes collected from 2 sites, before and after the long rainy season of 1988. The detection of specific human antibodies in mosquito blood meals by IFA, or by more efficient methods, may provide alternative approaches for large-scale, epidemiologic studies of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.

%X Two cross-sectional surveys of 954 persons in Asembo Bay and Got Nyabondo, western Kenya, were performed in August-September 1986, after long rains, and in February-March 1987, after a comparatively dry season. Serologic testing was performed using an ELISA with synthetic peptides representing repeat amino acid sequences of the Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), (EENV)5, (EENVEHDA)4, and (DDEHVEEPTVA)2 and repeat sequences (PNAN)5 and (NAAG)5 of the P. falciparum and P. malariae circumsporozoite proteins. In 1986, 45%, 73%, 72%, 85%, and 59% of the persons in Asembo Bay had antibodies to the respective peptides. In Got Nyabondo, the rates were 44%, 67%, 56%, 36%, and 41%, respectively. All positivity rates increased with age. When next determined in 1987, the positivity rates and levels of reactivity were generally unchanged in Asembo Bay, but were decreased in Got Nyabondo.

%X The role of interspecific hybridisation in the evolution of pest species is poorly understood. In mosquito disease vectors this is of particular importance due to the evolution of insecticide resistance and the proposed release of transgenic strains that are refractory to the malaria parasite. In this study, we apply population genetic methods in a novel manner to determine whether mitochondrial DNA sequences have introgressed between the closely related African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and A. arabiensis. Our results suggest that speciation was geologically recent and ancestral haplotypes at the ND5 locus are retained in both species. In addition, comparing haplotype frequencies in allopatric and sympatric populations, suggest locale specific unidirectional introgression of mitochondria from A. arabiensis into A. gambiae.

%X We have investigated the genetic diversity of the gene encoding the apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) in natural populations of Plasmodium falciparum from western Kenya and compared it with parasite populations from other geographic regions. A total of 28 complete sequences from Kenya, Thailand, India, and Venezuela field isolates were obtained. The genetic polymorphism is not evenly distributed across the gene, which is in agreement with the pattern reported in earlier studies. The alleles from Kenya exhibit 20 and 30% more polymorphism than that found in Southeast Asia and Venezuelan alleles, respectively. Based on the gene genealogies derived from sequencing data, no evidence for allele families was found. We have found evidence supporting limited gene flow between the parasite populations, specifically, between the Southeast Asian and Venezuelan isolates; however, no alleles could be linked to a specific geographic region. This study reveals that positive natural selection is an important factor in the maintenance of genetic diversity for AMA-1. We did not find conclusive evidence indicating intragenic recombination is important in the generation of the AMA-1 allelic diversity. The study provides information on the genetic diversity of the AMA-1 gene that would be useful in vaccine development and testing, as well as in assessing factors that are involved in the generation and maintenance of the genetic diversity in P. falciparum.

%X We have investigated the genetic diversity of the gene encoding the transmission-blocking vaccine antigen Pfs48/45 of Plasmodium falciparum parasites from western Kenya and compared it with parasite populations from Thailand, India, and Venezuela. We report 44 complete new sequences. Overall, the antigen is less polymorphic as compared with other pre-erythrocytic and blood stage antigens. Contrary to other P. falciparum antigens, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site exceeds the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site. We have found that the Pfs48/45 gene of Kenyan parasites is more polymorphic than parasites from other geographic origins. Our analysis reveals that positive natural selection is involved in the maintenance of the observed polymorphism. No evidence of intragenic recombination was found. Fst values reveal high levels of gene flow between India and Thailand, however, there are strong constraints in gene flow among Kenyan, Southeast Asian, and Venezuelan parasites. No alleles could be linked to a specific geographic region. The results of this study suggest that this gametocyte antigen, like other asexual blood stage antigens, is under selection pressure.

%X    Fenitronthion, an organophosphorus insecticide, was evaluated for residual
spraying in antimalaria programmes in a large-scale field trial near Kisumu, Kenya
from August 1972 to June 1976.
    The project involved entomological, parasitological and toxicological evaluation
of the insecticide applied in a hyper/holo-endemic malarious area covering
200 km2 inhabited by about 50 000 people.
    All houses and animal shelters were sprayed at a  target rate dosage of 2 g/m2
at three-month intervals for a total of eight consecutive spray rounds in two years.
    The malaria vectors. An. gambiae species A and B and An. funestus were reduced
to negligible densities indoors and outdoors immediately after initiation of
spraying and for 10 months after the last spray round. However, An, gambiae
reappeared at low densities during the main wet season enough to re-establish low
level transmission for short periods.
    The spraying produced marked and rapid decrease both in malaria incidence
and prevalence. A reduction in the daily probability of acquiring malaria infection
was confirmed from 0,009 before spraying to 0.0003 under spraying protection,
i.e. a 96% reduction.
    Data collected on a longitudinal basis indicated chat sustained spraying protection
would reduce malaria prevalence levels to an asymptotic limit of 6.9% under
the assumption that the inoculation and rate recovery will remain stable,
However, to attain malaria eradication in this type of epidemiological situation,
complementary measures such as mass drug administration appear to be necessary,

%! Impact of permethrin-treated bed nets on growth, nutritional status, and body composition of primary school children in western Kenya
%X Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) have been demonstrated to reduce morbidity and mortality in children less than five years of age. They have also been shown to improve the nutritional status of these children, but little is known about their impact on the nutritional status of school-age children. We evaluated the impact of ITNs on growth, nutritional status, and body composition of primary schoolchildren less than 13 years of age living in an area of intense perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya. The ITNs did not have a significant impact on linear growth or summary measures of protein-energy malnutrition in this age group. This lack of efficacy most likely relates to the reduced burden of malaria in this age group in a setting of stable transmission pressure. Use of ITNs was associated with a change in body composition with an increase in percent lean body mass (1.2%; P = 0.04). This may be consequent to reduced exposure to malaria with subsequent reduced elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to promote muscle wasting.

%X Although larvae feeding and food source are vital to the development, survival and population regulation of African malaria vectors, the prey organisms of Anopheles gambiae larvae in the natural environment have not been well studied. This study used a molecular barcoding approach to investigate the natural diets of Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in western Kenya. Gut contents from third- and fourth-instar larvae from natural habitats were dissected and DNA was extracted. The 18S ribosomal DNA gene was amplified, the resulting clones were screened using a restriction fragment length polymorphism method and nonmosquito clones were sequenced. Homology search and phylogenetic analyses were then conducted using the sequences of non-mosquito clones to identify the putative microorganisms ingested. The phylogenetic analyses clustered ingested microorganisms in four clades, including two clades of green algae (Chlorophyta, Chlorophyceae Class, Chlamydomonadales and Chlorococcales families), one fungal clade, and one unknown eukaryote clade. In parallel, using the same approach, an analysis of the biodiversity present in the larval habitats was carried out. This present study demonstrated the feasibility of the barcoding approach to infer the natural diets of Anopheles gambiae larvae. Our analysis suggests that despite the wide range of microorganisms available in natural habitats, mosquito larvae fed on specific groups of algae. The novel tools developed from this study can be used to improve our understanding of the larval ecology of African malaria vectors and to facilitate the development of new mosquito control tools.

%X The effect of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) on the spatial distribution of malaria vectors in neighboring villages lacking ITNs was studied during a randomized controlled trial of ITNs in western Kenya. There was a trend of decreased abundance of Anopheles gambiae with decreasing distance from intervention villages both before (P = 0.027) and after (P = 0.002) introduction of ITNs, but this trend was significantly stronger after ITNs were introduced (P = 0.05). For An. funestus, no pre-intervention trend was observed (P = 0.373), but after the intervention, a trend of decreased abundance with closer proximity to intervention compounds developed (P = 0.027). Reduction in mosquito populations in villages lacking ITNs was most apparent in compounds located within 600 meters of intervention villages. Sporozoite infection rates decreased in control areas following the introduction of ITNs (P < 0.001 for both species), but no spatial association was detected between sporozoite rates and distance to nearest intervention village. We conclude that high coverage of ITNs is associated with a community-wide suppression of mosquito populations that is detectable in neighboring villages lacking ITNs, thereby affording individuals residing in these villages some protection against malaria.

%X A longitudinal survey of mosquito larval habitats was carried out in Asembo Bay, western Kenya, during the rainy season of 1998. All pools of standing water along a 700-m transect were sampled twice per week. For each habitat, eight environmental variables were recorded and a sample of anopheline larvae was collected for identification. In total, 1,751 Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 2,784 Anopheles funestus Giles were identified. Identification of An. gambiae s.l. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that 240 (14.7%) were An. gambiae Giles and 858 (52.4%) were An. arabiensis Patton; PCR failed to identify 539 (32.9%) specimens. Repeated measures logistic regression analysis indicated that An. gambiae and An. arabiensis larvae were associated with small, temporary habitats with algae and little or no aquatic vegetation. Anopheles funestus larvae were associated with larger, semipermanent bodies of water containing aquatic vegetation and algae. Direct comparison of habitat characteristics associated with either An. gambiae or An. arabiensis revealed that algae were associated more commonly with habitats containing An. gambiae; no other differences were detected. Chi-square analysis indicated that these species were collected from the same habitat more frequently than would be expected by chance alone. Together, these results indicate that An. gambiae and An. arabiensis have similar requirements for the larval environment and that, at least in western Kenya, they do not segregate into separate habitats.

%X The effect of permethrin-treated bed nets (ITNs) on malaria vectors was studied as part of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial in western Kenya. Indoor resting densities of fed Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus in intervention houses were 58.5% (P = 0.010) and 94.5% (P = 0.001) lower, respectively, compared with control houses. The sporozoite infection rate in An. gambiae s.l. was 0.8% in intervention areas compared with 3.4% (P = 0.026) in control areas, while the sporozoite infection rates in An. funestus were not significantly different between the two areas. We estimated the overall transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in intervention areas to be 90% lower than in control areas. Permethrin resistance was not detected during the study period. As measured by densities of An. gambiae s.l., the efficacy of bed nets decreased if one or more residents did not sleep under a net or if bed nets had not been re-treated within six months. These results indicate that ITNs are optimally effective if used every night and if permethrin is reapplied at least biannually.

%X Tests were carried out in Kenya to determine whether the enzyme-linked synthetic oligonucleotide probe (pAna 1) developed for identifying species of the Anopheles gambiae complex could be used under field conditions. The An. arabiensis male-specific pAna 1 probe was able to identify all male larval instars and adult males. However, the non-radioactive assay was not sufficiently sensitive to identify male sperm DNA in all the mated female An. arabiensis. Although the ratio of An. arabiensis to An. gambiae s.s. identified with pAna 1 in males during the dry season was in agreement with the ratio in half-gravid females identified cytogenetically, the ratios were different during the wet season. This study demonstrates that the enzyme-linked DNA probe assay is applicable under field conditions.

%X In Kenya indoor and outdoor resting densities of Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus at the Ahero rice irrigation scheme, and Anopheles gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis and An. funestus at the Miwani sugar belt were assessed for 13 months by pyrethrum spray collections in houses and granaries. The vector's house leaving behaviour was evaluated with exit traps and it was noted that early exophily (i.e., deliberate) was not detected in any of the vectors. Assortative indoor/outdoor resting behaviour was studied by a capture-mark-release-recapture method and showed that in An. arabiensis both indoor and outdoor resting traits were present in the same individuals. Samples of half-gravid female An. gambiae s.l. were chromosomally identified either as Anopheles gambiae s.s. or An. arabiensis and in a subsample chromosomal inversions were read. Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis had the 2Rb inversion but in addition the 2La inversion was found in An. gambiae s.s. and this is an indication of low chromosomal variation. At Ahero An. arabiensis was most abundant when the rice crop was immature and An. funestus when the crop was mature. This succession of vectors facilitated the transmission of malaria throughout the year. At Miwani, An. gambiae s.l. population peaked during the long rains but the proportion of An. arabiensis was highest during the dry season. The indoor resting density of males of the three vector species was less than half of the females.

%X Blood meals were obtained from indoor and outdoor resting malaria vectors in three villages of western Kenya and tested by sandwich ELISA to determine host preferences and their human blood index (HBI). Anopheles gambiae s.s. collected indoors at Kisian village had a HBI of 0.97 while that of Anopheles arabiensis collected at Ahero was 0.23. However, the HBI of A. arabiensis varied depending on the availability of outdoor resting shelters. Most female A. arabiensis (98.9%) collected outdoors in granaries at Ahero had fed on cattle. Indoor-collected female Anopheles funestus had mainly fed on people (93.0%), but taken at least some of their blood (20.2%) from cattle. Although small numbers of A. arabiensis fed on sheep or goats and birds, none of the female A. gambiae s.s. and A. funestus tested had fed on these hosts. The absence of human-fed A. arabiensis in outdoor shelters indicated that exiting after feeding, a behaviour pattern that mitigates indoor insecticidal spraying, is not prevalent in this species in western Kenya.

%X 1. Work on the mosquitos frequenting native huts was carried out at Kisumu, Nyanza Province, Kenya, during 1940–41.2. During preliminary night and day catches in native huts the catching methods were standardised. Subsequently four identical huts were built side by side for comparative work. They were designed specially for easy catching and had hessian ceilings. Apart from catches made for special purposes, 6 day catches and 1 night catch were made every week in one of the huts for an entire year. This hut was regarded as a control. Records of climate were kept in this control hut for a year, the readings being compared with readings taken in a Stevenson screen outside.3. It was found that the temperature range in the hut was only about half that in the screen—in other words, a native hut is a very well insulated structure. In hot, dry weather there were considerable differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures but in cool wet weather the differences were very small. Thermograph records showed that the form of the daily temperature curve in wet weather was quite different from that in dry weather. Temperature in the hut very rarely fell below the level at which development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito is arrested. In the screen it very frequently did so in the hours before dawn.4. Hygrograph records of relative humidity in the hut and screen showed much the same characteristics as the temperature readings. Again the range in the hut was much smaller than that in the screen and differences between indoor and screen humidities were great in dry weather and small in wet weather. The form of the daily curve in dry weather differed markedly from the wet weather curve. Saturation deficit at night was always greater in the hut than outside.5. At night, the climate of a hut containing 10 natives was compared with that of the control hut, containing 1 native. It was found that the crowded hut was slightly warmer than the other and that its relative humidity was somewhat lower than that of the control hut.6. High wind at night was unusual. When it occurred the entry of mosquitos to huts was stopped for the time being.7. A list of all species encountered is given, with locality records and sites of capture.8. From the results of night catches the entry curves of various species were worked out. It was found that in the case of A. gambiae females there is a high population of resting mosquitos at 7 p.m., a period of low entry from 8 to 10 p.m., a period of high entry from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., and a sharp entry peak at 6 a.m., due to the arrival of females seeking shelter for the day. The same remarks apply to A. funestus females, but the time distribution of the entry periods is different, namely :—7 p.m., a high population of resting mosquitos ; 8 p.m.–2 a.m., a long period of low entry ; 3–5 a.m., a short period of high entry ; 6 a.m., a large entry of females seeking shelter. In the case of both species, most of the females taken were fed, and there is close correlation between the curves for fed and total females. It is thought that females remain in the hut after feeding. Mature females with Group V ovaries enter mainly at dawn. Males of both species are scarce during the night but enter in large numbers at 6 a.m. to rest during the day. A. coustani and A. pharoensis are scarce in the evening and at dawn. A. coustani shows a well defined entry peak from 11 p.m. till midnight and A. pharoensis from midnight till 2 a.m. T. africanus and T. uniformis act rather similarly. T. uniformis shows a very distinct entry peak at 9 p.m. and T. africanus from 9 to 11 p.m. There is close correlation in this case between unfed and total females. It is thought that these species leave the hut soon after biting and that their biting activity is at a maximum between 9 and 11 p.m. Thus the entry curves of the important species show a succession of entry peaks through the night—T. uniformis, 9 p.m. ; T. africanus, 9–11 p.m. ; A. coustani, 11–12 p.m. ; A. pharoensis, 12 p.m.–2 a.m. ; A. gambiae, 11 p.m.–6 a.m. ; A. funestus, 3–6 a.m.9. Night catches, comparing dark and dimly lighted tents, showed that A. coustani entered tents in large numbers and preferred the lighted tent, as did T. africanus and T. uniformis. C. nebulosus preferred the dark tent. Catches made in the open showed that A. gambiae and A. funestus prefer to bite in huts, T. africanus and T. uniformis in the open.10. Comparison of night and day catches showed that the mosquitos taken may be divided into 4 groups :—1. True house-haunting species, A. gambiae and A. funestus. Females are abundant both by night and by day, males by day only. These species enter both for food and for shelter. Day catches, which included both males and females, give the best estimate of prevalence.2. Species which enter mainly to feed, T. africanus and T. uniformis ; perhaps A. coustani and A. pharoensis. Females are common by night but are never numerous by day. Males are always scarce. Night catches are essential for an understanding of this group.3. Species which enter human habitations mainly for shelter, C. antennatus. Females are prevalent by day only.4. Species which enter casually and are scarce both by night and by day.11. Analysis of day catches showed that the great majority of A. gambiae and A. funestus females had Grade 1 wings. Sometimes the wings were still undamaged when the ovary was maturing for the second time. Ovary dissections of these species showed that the largest numbers belonged to Group I and that the percentage in this group became higher at times of increase. Most females of these species and of T. africanus and T. uniformis contained blood. Of the unfed A. gambiae and A. funestus, the great majority had Group I ovaries, i.e., they were young females which had never yet fed.12. Analysis of an A. gambiae increase (December 1940–January 1941) by ovary dissection of day catches showed that the whole increase was dependent on a constant supply of young females with Group I ovaries. As soon as this supply diminished the increase came to an end. It seems, therefore, that the life of the female was short at that season. The numbers of males and females taken were closely correlated throughout.13. In day catches the great majority of Anophelines were taken on the ceiling. Taeniorhynchus spp. were commonest on the walls. Very few mosquitos were found on the floor. With regard to mosquitos taken on the walls, it was found that all species preferred the lower and darker half. Catches made on the outside of the walls consisted mainly of male Anophelines.14. In comparative series of catches made to determine the best hour for day catching, no significant difference was found between catches made at all hours from 6 to 11 a.m.15. Preliminary tests showed that there was probably a quantitative relationship between the numbers of human inhabitants of a hut and the numbers of mosquitos taken. This was confirmed by night and day catches made simultaneously in huts with 1, 5, 10 and 15 inhabitants respectively. It was found that there was a very close direct relationship between the size of the human population and the numbers of females of biting species taken. Non-biting species did not discriminate between the huts.16. Comparison was made between huts containing 5 washed and 5 unwashed natives respectively. All the important biting species preferred the hut with the unwashed natives.17. In night catches, A. gambiae and A. funestus females preferred a hut containing dirty clothing only to a completely empty hut. Females of T. africanus and T. uniformis showed no such preference.18. Catches in empty huts showed a relative but not an absolute increase in Anopheline males.19. It was found that a hut subdivided by a hessian curtain could be used for preference experiments with varying human population.20. In a comparison between a hut containing a native and one containing a calf, it was found that A. gambiae and A. funestus were more numerous in the hut with the native both by day and by night. A. funestus showed a more marked preference for the native than did A. gambia . A. coustani, A. pharoensis and C. antennatus showed a distinct preference for the calf. In the hut with the native, Anophelines formed 94 per cent. of the total catch, but in the calf hut Culicines formed 95 per cent. of the total.21. It is shown that at Kisumu the seasonal incidence of A. gambiae is dependent on local rainfall. The relationship is qualitative rather than quantitative. A threshold figure of 5 inches of rain per month is necessary before an increase can take place. When an increase does occur, the population in the first month of the increase is proportional not to the amount of rain which has fallen but to the lower initial population of the preceding month. If the increase is maintained for several months, the growth of the population takes place in geometrical ratio.22. At Kisumu the seasonal incidence of A. funestus is not connected with local rainfall. Increases take place when the level of Victoria Nyanza rises. The rise in lake level is dependent on the rainfall of a large part of East Africa and is independent of local rainfall.23. The seasonal incidence of other species is briefly discussed.24. The parasites noted from mosquitos were mites, which were most prevalent on A. coustani and A. gambiae, and Coelomomyces africanus which was commonest in A. funestus. Coelomomyces is a fungous parasite which causes destruction of the ovaries. It is now recorded from Kenya for the first time. Unsuccessful attempts were made to infect larvae with this fungus, but naturally infected larvae were found.25. Unsuccessful attempts were made to render adult mosquitos individually recognisable by staining the larvae with various dyes. Attempts to make the blood-meal recognisable by injecting identifiable substances into the blood-stream of the human bait were also failures.

%X 1. Two series of hourly measurements of temperature and light intensity, each extending over 24 hours, were made in artificial pools. One pool contained clear water, one muddy water, one standing grass 1 ft. high and one was completely shaded by papyrus matting at a height of 1 ft. Shade temperature records were kept in a Stevenson screen.2. The results showed that the grass had a pronounced insulating effect on temperature. The range in the grassy pool was less than that in the screen and less than half than that in the open pool. The grassy pool was warmer by night and cooler by day than the open pool. No essential difference was noted between the temperature cycle of the clear open pool and the muddy open pool nor between the grassy pool with broken shade and the pool receiving complete shade from matting. Maximum light intensity in the grassy pool was less than half that attained in the open pool.3. It is concluded that not only do the breeding waters of A. gambiae reach much higher temperatures than those of such species as A. funestus, A. coustani and A. pharoensis, but that they also undergo much greater temperature fluctuations.

%! Implications of the western Kenya permethrin-treated bed net study for policy, program implementation, and future research
%X The fifth, and probably last, large-scale, group-randomized, controlled trial of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) showed that ITNs are efficacious in reducing all-cause post-neonatal mortality in an area of intense, perennial malaria transmission. The trial helped to define pregnant women and infants as target groups for this intervention in high transmission settings. High population coverage with ITNs in both target and non-target groups may be critical to enhance health and survival in pregnant women and infants. The proportion of households with ITNs (coverage), the proportion of individuals properly deploying ITNs each night (adherence), and the proportion of nets properly treated with insecticide (treatment) are the three key determinants of effectiveness of large-scale ITN programs. These three simple outcomes should serve as the basis for program objectives and monitoring and evaluation efforts. Coverage effects and economic analysis support the proposition that ITNs may be viewed as a public good, worthy of public support. Research should continue to improve the intervention tools (the net, the insecticide, and methods for durable treatment and re-treatment) and their deployment.

24 satellites orbiting at an altitude of about 10,900 miles. The authors
describe how a simple modification of GPS known as differential GPS (DGPS)
can be used to produce a highly accurate base map in a tropical area.
DGPS circumvents the effects of selective availability (SA) error, an
intentional error component added for security purposes at each satellite,
to yield a highly accurate position fix. This paper documents the use of
DGPS to obtain highly accurate longitudes, latitudes, and altitudes of
1169 houses, 15 schools, 40 churches, 4 health care centers, 48 major
mosquito breeding sites, 10 borehole wells, 7 shopping areas, major roads,
streams, the shore of Lake Victoria, and other geographic features of
interest associated with a longitudinal study of malaria in 15 villages in
western Kenya. 70 sq. km were mapped, including 42.0 km of roads, 54.3 km
of streams, and 15.0 km of lake shore. Location data were entered into a
geographic information system for map production and linkage with various
databases for spatial analyses. Spatial analyses using parasitologic and
entomologic data are presented as examples. Less than $25,000 was spent
upon this project, of which $15,000 was for hardware and software.

%X SummaryBackground Nitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of immunity to malaria, and genetic polymorphisms in the promoter of the inducible NO synthase gene (NOS2) could modulate production of NO. We postulated that NOS2 promoter polymorphisms would affect resistance to severe malaria. Methods We assessed genomic DNA from healthy children and from those diagnosed with malaria from Tanzania (n=47 and n=138, respectively) and Kenya (n=1106) for polymorphisms by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. We also measured in-vivo NO production in Tanzanian children. Findings We identified a novel single nucleotide polymorphism, −1173 C/T, in the NOS2 promoter that was significantly associated with protection from symptomatic malaria (odds ratio 0·12, 95% Cl 0·03–0·48, p=0·0006) in 179 Tanzanian children, and significantly associated with protection from severe malarial anaemia (adjusted relative risk 0·25, 95% Cl 0·09–0·66, p=0·0005) in 1106 Kenyan children studied over 5 years. The risk of parasitaemia was not significantly different in wild-type or −1173 C/T individuals. −1173 C/T protection in Tanzanians was independent of the previously recognised NOS2−954 G/C polymorphism. The (CCTTT)n NOS2 polymorphism (Tanzania and Kenya) was not associated with severe malaria outcomes. −1173 C/T was associated with increased fasting urine and plasma NO metabolite concentrations in Tanzanian children, suggesting that the polymorphism was functional in vivo. Interpretation The NOS2 promoter −1173 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with protection against cerebral malaria and severe malarial anaemia. Increased NO production in individuals with the −1173 C/T polymorphism lends support to a protective role for NO against these syndromes. Targeted interventions to increase NO delivery or production could provide novel preventive and therapeutic strategies against these major causes of mortality in African children.

%X BACKGROUND: Anopheles gambiae eggs are more frequently found on soil around puddle habitats of the larvae, than on the water surface itself in Western Kenya. Thus, eggs can experience temperatures more wide-ranging and lethal than those experienced by larvae or pupae confined within puddles. METHODS: Small batches of eggs from house-collected An. gambiae as well as from the Kisumu laboratory strain were bathed for defined times in water whose temperature was precisely controlled. Daily temperature profiles were recorded by an infrared thermometer on seven different days in and around three types of typical An. gambiae larval habitats at Kisian. RESULTS: For wild eggs, significant mortality occurred upon brief heating between 42-44 degrees C. Few eggs hatched after 10 min at 45 degrees C and none hatched above this temperature. A similar pattern occurred for eggs of the Kisumu strain, except it was shifted downwards by 1 degrees C. Egg mortality was time-dependent above 40 degrees C. Temperatures of water in the three types of larval habitats never exceeded 35 degrees C. Wet or damp mud rarely and only briefly exceeded 40 degrees C; thus, water and mud would be highly conducive to egg survival and development. However, dry soils frequently reached 40-50 degrees C for several h. Eggs stranded on dry surfaces would experience substantial mortality on hot, sunny days. CONCLUSION: Moist mud around puddles constitutes suitable habitat for An. gambiae eggs; however, eggs on the surface of dry soil under direct sunlight are unlikely to survive for more than a few hours.

%X Microgeographic differentiation in Anopheles gambiae from seven villages less than 10 km apart in Asembo Bay, western Kenya was estimated by analysis of variability in seven microsatellite loci. Results from the Asembo Bay villages were compared with specimens collected in Kilifi, coastal Kenya, 700 km to the east. Allele frequency distribution was very similar in all villages in Asembo Bay, but differed for the Kilifi population. Genetic differentiation among villages was low with loci-specific Fst falling within the range of 0.0000-0.0085. These low estimates of differentiation correspond to among-village migration indices greater than 5.66, suggesting a high level of gene flow within the Asembo population. The Nm value between Kilifi and Asembo Bay was 1.54, indicating much lower levels of gene flow. Average observed heterozygosity among the seven villages was in all but one case less than the expected heterozygosity, most likely indicating the presence of null alleles, but possibly the presence of randomly mating units (demes) smaller than the village. We conclude that there is likely no genetic structure at the level of the village in Asembo Bay but that gene flow is restricted between western and coastal Kenya, probably by the high elevation rift.

%X We analysed genetic variability in Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles gambiae populations using microsatellite loci to determine whether the Rift Valley restricts the flow of genes. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations were significant, and were most likely to be due to the high frequency of null alleles observed. An. arabiensis populations occurring between 40 and 700 km apart across the Eastern arm of the Rift Valley were not differentiated (pair-wise F(ST) range: 0.0033-0.0265, P > 0.05). Neither were An. gambiae populations from Asembo Bay and Ghana (F(ST): 0.0063, P > 0.05) despite a geographical separation of about 5000 km. In contrast, significant differentiation was observed between An. gambiae populations from Asembo Bay and Kilifi (about 700 km apart; F(ST) = 0.1249, P < 0.01), suggesting the presence of a barrier to gene flow.

%X We sampled Anopheles funestus Giles mosquitoes from 10 sites in Kenya to determine (1) the different members of this group present at these sites and (2) the population genetic structure of these species based on chromosomal inversion karyotypes with particular reference to the role of the Eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley and geographical distance as barriers to gene flow. Four members of this species group, namely An. funestus s.s., An. parensis, An. leesoni, and An. rivulorum, were found. An. funestus was found almost exclusively inside human dwellings while An. rivulorum was found almost exclusively outdoors. An. parensis was found both indoors and outdoors in comparable proportions. Earlier attempts to collect this group of mosquitoes from two of the sites yielded no mosquitoes, suggesting that numbers of mosquitoes change during the year, sometime reaching zero or very near zero. Significant levels of differentiation were observed among some An. funestus s.s. populations studied. Results suggest that the Rift Valley acts as a barrier to gene flow for An. funestus, but that levels of differentiation are not associated with the geographical distance between populations. The results are discussed in the light of the fact that inversions may have some adaptive significance to differences in environmental conditions.

%! Effects of permethrin-treated bed nets on immunity to malaria in western Kenya II. Antibody responses in young children in an area of intense malaria transmission
%X As part of a large community-based trial on the impact of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) on childhood morbidity and mortality in an area of intense perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya, we assessed the effects of ITNs on malaria-specific humoral responses in young children. The IgG responses to Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1) and the blood stage antigen merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-119 kD) in children less than three years old were investigated during a series of cross-sectional surveys. At 14 and 22 months after the introduction of ITNs, the frequencies and levels of IgG to CSP and LSA-1 were significantly lower in children from ITN villages than in children from control villages (P < 0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of IgG to MSP-1 was significantly higher in children from ITN villages at 14 months (P = 0.0069), but not at 22 months. Our results show that decreased exposure by ITNs reduces IgG responses to pre-erythrocytic antigens, but there was no evidence that two years of ITN use compromises IgG responses to blood stage antigens in these young children in this malaria holoendemic area.

%X As part of a community-based group-randomized trial on the impact of permethrin-treated bed nets (ITNs) on malaria in pregnancy in a holoendemic area of western Kenya, we assessed their effects on antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens (recombinant circumsporozoite protein [CSP] and peptides complimentary to the repeat region of the liver stage antigen-1 [LSA-1]) and blood stage antigen (recombinant C-terminal domain of the merozoite surface protein-1 [MSP-119 kD]) in paired maternal/cord plasma samples obtained from 296 deliveries (157 from ITN villages and 139 control villages). Levels of total IgG and IgG subclasses 1–3 to LSA-1 and total IgG and IgG3 to MSP-1 were lower, whereas those of total IgG to CSP were significantly higher in women from ITN villages than those from control villages. In cord plasma, levels of total IgG and IgG2 to LSA-1 and IgG3 to MSP-1 were lower in ITN villages than in control villages, but antibody responses to CSP were similar. Our results suggest that the use of ITNs decreases antibody responses to LSA-1 and MSP-1 antigens in pregnant women with associated reductions in levels of the same antibodies in cord blood. In contrast, ITN use was found to be associated with increased antibody responses to CSP in pregnant women, but had no effect on antibody levels to CSP in cord blood.

%X Community participation and leadership in initiating and implementing a health development programme in Saradidi, Kenya were examined. Organization of the area into villages had to be sensitive to existing community organizational structures such as geography, religion, kinship and administrative boundaries. The lowest level government leaders did not always have the support of the community. Some groups such as women and those who were not wealthy were not always included in leadership positions; these people, however, were often most aware of certain village problems. In Saradidi, women's groups were important for community development; they supported the volunteer community health workers and carried out many village health activities. Many village health committees did not function effectively. Village health workers were supported principally by the programme centre. Village income-generating activities were not very successful. Group involvement in income raising ventures proved to be inefficient; many ended up as income draining activities. Village group income projects must be well selected relative to the skills and resources available and the ability of the product to be marketed; only exceptional ones should be encouraged. Those based at the programme's centre were more successful perhaps because of a greater investment in skills, money and marketing. Age was an important factor in accepted leadership roles in Saradidi; most effective leaders were more than 45 years of age. Village health helpers volunteered a significant proportion of their time despite poor support by village health committees and no financial remuneration. The central project structure and the training they received compensated for the lack of guidance by village health committees.

In line with the theoretical considerations made for the implementation of primary health care the community was involved in planning, organization, setting of priorities and objectives, implementation and evaluation of the programme. The Saradidi Health Development Project (SHDP) was initiated by people from the area with material assistance from within and outside Saradidi. Nearly 10 years since the beginning of the project, the SHDP still runs more or less on its own providing experiences for other projects and initiators.

%X Anopheles funestus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of Africa's major malaria vectors. To understand population structure within An. funestus, various molecular markers have recently been developed. We investigated the impact of the Rift Valley on one such molecular marker, a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). This system distinguishes An. funestus populations into types M, W, and MW. Generally, these types correlate between geographical location and RFLP type, whereby M associates essentially with eastern Africa, W with western and central Africa, and MW with southern Africa. In total, 606 specimens were screened from 12 countries. Specimens from southern African localities were of the expected MW-type with the exception of the sample from Malawi, which showed all three types. The specimens from Tanzania showed the M- and MW-types, whereas specimens from Kenya showed M- and W-types. We also recorded different RFLP types not recorded previously. Type Y was recorded in Malawi, and Z-type was recorded from four localities: Angola, Malawi, Ghana, and Zambia.

%! Prevalence and severity of malnutrition in pre-school children in a rural area of western Kenya
%X We determined the nutritional status of children less than five years of age in an area in rural western Kenya with intense malaria transmission, a high prevalence of severe anemia and human immunodeficiency virus, and high infant and under-five mortality (176/1,000 and 259/1,000). No information is available on the prevalence of malnutrition in this area. Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 1996 and 1998 to monitor the effect of insecticide-treated bed nets on child morbidity. Anthropometric indices are presented for 2,103 children collected prior to and during intervention (controls only). The prevalence of stunting (Z-scores for height-for-age [HAZ] <−2), wasting (Z-scores for weight-for-height [WHZ] <−2) and being underweight (Z-scores for weight-for-age [WAZ] <−2) was 30%, 4%, and 20%, respectively. This was severe (Z-score <−3) in 12% (stunting), 1% (wasting), and 5% (underweight) of the children. Few children less than three months of age were malnourished (<2%), but height-for-age and weight-for-age deficits increased rapidly in children 3–18 months of age, and were greatest in children 18–23 months old (44% stunted and 34% underweight). While the mean HAZ and WAZ stabilized from 24 months of age onwards, they still remained substantially below the reference median with no evidence of catch-up growth. Malnutrition is likely to interact with infectious diseases, placing children 3–24 months of age at high risk of premature death in this area.

%X OBJECTIVE: Nutritional status is an important marker of overall health and linear growth retardation has serious long-term physiological and economic consequences. Approximately 35 and 29% of preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa are stunted and underweight, respectively. There is relatively little information available about the nutritional status in adolescents, the age group with the highest growth velocity after infancy. We conducted a series of cross-sectional surveys to determine the prevalence and main risk groups for malnutrition and to describe the associations between age, sexual maturation and nutritional status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya. DESIGN: Three cross-sectional surveys; one in Mumias, using random sampling in all schools, and two surveys in Asembo, using a multi-stage random sample design. SETTING: Public primary schools in two different rural malaria endemic areas in western Kenya with high levels of malnutrition in preschool children. SUBJECTS: In all, 928 randomly selected adolescent schoolgirls aged 12-18 y. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of stunting and thinness was 12.1 and 15.6%, respectively. Of the total, 2% were severely stunted. Menarche and start of puberty were delayed by approximately 1.5-2 y compared to a US reference population. The prevalence of stunting and thinness decreased with age and mean height for age z-scores converged towards the median of the US reference curve. Girls who had not yet started menstruating were more likely to be stunted than the girls of the same age who were post-menarche. CONCLUSIONS: Stunting and thinness are common in young adolescent schoolgirls in these poor rural settings in western Kenya, but the prevalence decreases with age, providing observational support that children catch up on incomplete growth attained earlier in life due to a maturational delay of 1.5-2 y allowing prolonged growth.

%! Permethrin-treated bed nets in the prevention of malaria and anemia in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya
%X The impact of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) on the health of adolescent schoolgirls was investigated during a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of ITNs in western Kenya. Two school-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence of malaria and anemia in 644 schoolgirls 12–18 years old in a rural area with intense perennial malaria transmission. In 12- and 13-year-old schoolgirls, ITNs were associated with a reduced prevalence of all cause anemia (hemoglobin level <12 g/dL, 16.9% versus 31.4%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.21, 0.69%) and a 0.34 g/dL (95% CI = 0.02, 0.66) increase in mean hemoglobin concentrations. No beneficial effect on all-cause anemia (adjusted OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.43, 1.45) or hemoglobin concentrations (difference in mean = 0.14 g/dL, 95% CI = −0.24, 0.53) was evident in older girls. In all age groups, no effect was found on malaria parasite prevalence or density, clinical malaria, all-cause morbidity, standard measures of nutritional status and growth, or the use of antimalarials and other medications. ITNs approximately halved the prevalence of mild anemia in young, school-attending, non-pregnant, adolescent girls, but had no impact in older girls or on other malaria-associated morbidity or nutritional status.

Variation (Genetics)
%X The population genetic structure of the Anopheles gambiae in western Kenya was studied using length variation at five microsatellite loci and sequence variation in a 648-nt mtDNA fragment. Mosquitoes were collected from houses in villages spanning up to 50 km distance. The following questions were answered. (i) Are mosquitoes in a house more related genetically to each other than mosquitoes between houses? (ii) What degree of genetic differentiation occurs on these geographical scales? (iii) How consistent are the results obtained with both types of genetic markers? At the house level, no differentiation was detected by FST and RST, and the band sharing index test revealed no significant associations of alleles across loci. Likewise, indices of kinship based on mtDNA haplotypes in houses were even lower than in the pooled sample. Therefore, the hypothesis that mosquitoes in a house are more related genetically was rejected. At increasing geographical scales, microsatellite allele distributions were similar among all population samples and no subdivision of the gene pool was detected by FST or RST. Likewise, estimates of haplotype divergence of mtDNA between populations were not higher than the within population estimates, and mtDNA-based FST values were not significantly different from zero. That sequence variation in mtDNA provided matching results with microsatellite loci (while high genetic variation was observed in all loci), suggested that this pattern represents the whole genome. The minimum area associated with a deme of A. gambiae in western Kenya is therefore larger than 50 km in diameter.

%X We estimated current and long-term effective population size (Ne) of two Anopheles gambiae (savanna cytotype) populations in Kenya. Temporal variation at nine microsatellite loci in each population sampled 7 and 9 years apart and genetic diversity in each sample were analyzed to answer the following questions. (1) Do bottlenecks occur in Kenyan populations of A. gambiae? (2) How variable are different populations with respect to their current and long-term Ne values? (3) What are the implications of these results on population structure and history? The estimates of Ne of Asembo and Jego were 6,359 and 4,258, respectively, and the lower 95% limits were 2,455 and 1,669, respectively. Thus, despite the typical observation of low density at the village level during the dry season, large populations are maintained annually. Large current Ne is consistent with previous studies showing low differentiation across the continent, especially under Wright's isolation-by-distance model. Current Ne in Asembo was 1.5-fold higher than in Jego, but this difference was not significant. Long-term Ne in Asembo (22,667) was 2.9-fold higher than that in Jego (7,855) based on the stepwise mutation model. The difference between populations was significant at both time points regardless of whether long-term Ne values were calculated based on the stepwise mutation model or the infinite-alleles model. Heterozygosity in Jego declined significantly between 1987 (59%) and 1996 (54%), whereas heterozygosity in Asembo was stable (66%-65%). Despite the relatively high and significant differentiation between Asembo and Jego (FST = 0.072-0.10, RST = 0.037-0.038), all alleles in Jego were found in Asembo but not vice versa. All of these findings suggest that lower Ne in Jego magnifies differentiation between the two populations. The long-term Ne was biased downward, because its calculation was based on an upper bound estimate of microsatellite mutation rate. Ne values based on mtDNA and allozymes were an order of magnitude higher. Long-term Ne therefore, is probably measured in hundreds of thousands and hence does not support a recent expansion of this species from a small population.

%X Genetic variation of Anopheles gambiae was analysed to assess interpopulation divergence over a 6000 km distance using short tandem repeat (microsatellite) loci and allozyme loci. Differentiation of populations from Kenya and Senegal measured by allele length variation at five microsatellite loci was compared with estimates calculated from published data on six allozyme loci (Miles, 1978). The average Wright's F-ST of microsatellite loci (0.016) was lower than that of allozymes (0.036). Slatkin's R(ST) values for microsatellite loci were generally higher than their F-ST values, but the average R(ST) value was virtually identical (0.036) to the average allozyme F-ST. These low estimates of differentiation correspond to an effective migration index (Nm) larger than 3, suggesting that gene flow across the continent is only weakly restricted. Polymorphism of microsatellite loci was significantly higher than that of allozymes, probably because the former experience considerably higher mutation rates. That microsatellite loci did not measure greater interpopulation divergence than allozyme loci suggested constraints on microsatellite evolution. Alternatively, extensive mosquito dispersal, aided by human transportation during the last century, better explains the low differentiation and the similarity of estimates derived from both types of genetic markers.

%X BACKGROUND: As pathogens that circumvent the host immune response are favoured by selection, so are host alleles that reduce parasite load. Such evolutionary processes leave their signature on the genes involved. Deciphering modes of selection operating on immune genes might reveal the nature of host-pathogen interactions and factors that govern susceptibility in host populations. Such understanding would have important public health implications. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We analyzed polymorphisms in four mosquito immune genes (SP14D1, GNBP, defensin, and gambicin) to decipher selection effects, presumably mediated by pathogens. Using samples of Anopheles arabiensis, An. quadriannulatus and four An. gambiae populations, as well as published sequences from other Culicidae, we contrasted patterns of polymorphisms between different functional units of the same gene within and between populations. Our results revealed selection signatures operating on different time scales. At the most recent time scale, within-population diversity revealed purifying selection. Between populations and between species variation revealed reduced differentiation (GNBP and gambicin) at coding vs. noncoding- regions, consistent with balancing selection. McDonald-Kreitman tests between An. quadriannulatus and both sibling species revealed higher fixation rate of synonymous than nonsynonymous substitutions (GNBP) in accordance with frequency dependent balancing selection. At the longest time scale (>100 my), PAML analysis using distant Culicid taxa revealed positive selection at one codon in gambicin. Patterns of genetic variation were independent of exposure to human pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND CONCLUSIONS: Purifying selection is the most common form of selection operating on immune genes as it was detected on a contemporary time scale on all genes. Selection for "hypervariability" was not detected, but negative balancing selection, detected at a recent evolutionary time scale between sibling species may be rather common. Detection of positive selection at the deepest evolutionary time scale suggests that it occurs infrequently, possibly in association with speciation events. Our results provided no evidence to support the hypothesis that selection was mediated by pathogens that are transmitted to humans.

%X CONTEXT: Insecticide-treated bednets reduce malaria transmission and child morbidity and mortality in short-term trials, but this impact may not be sustainable. Previous investigators have suggested that bednet use might paradoxically increase mortality in older children through delayed acquisition of immunity to malaria. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adherence to and public health benefits of insecticide-treated bednets can be sustained over time and whether bednet use during infancy increases all-cause mortality rates in older children in an area of intense perennial malaria transmission. DESIGN AND SETTING: A community randomized controlled trial in western Kenya (phase 1: January 1997 to February 2000) followed by continued surveillance of adherence, entomologic parameters, morbidity indicators, and all-cause mortality (phase 2: April 1999 to February 2002), and extended demographic monitoring (January to December 2002). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 130,000 residents of 221 villages in Asembo and Gem were randomized to receive insecticide-treated bednets at the start of phase 1 (111 villages) or phase 2 (110 villages). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of children younger than 5 years using insecticide-treated bednets, mean number of Anopheles mosquitoes per house, and all-cause mortality rates. RESULTS: Adherence to bednet use in children younger than 5 years increased from 65.9% in phase 1 to 82.5% in phase 2 (P<.001). After 3 to 4 years of bednet use, the mean number of Anopheles mosquitoes per house in the study area was 77% lower than in a neighboring area without bednets (risk ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.35). All-cause mortality rates in infants aged 1 to 11 months were significantly reduced in intervention villages during phase 1 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90); low rates were maintained during phase 2. Mortality rates did not differ during 2002 (after up to 6 years of bednet use) between children from former intervention and former control households born during phase 1 (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.86-1.19). CONCLUSIONS: The public health benefits of insecticide-treated bednets were sustained for up to 6 years. There is no evidence that bednet use from birth increases all-cause mortality in older children in an area of intense perennial transmission of malaria.

%X Insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) significantly reduce malaria vector populations. Susceptibility to ITNs differs by vector species, and culicine mosquitoes have not been shown to be significantly affected by the use of ITNs. We examined the impact of 2-4 yr of ITN use on malaria vector species distribution and culicine mosquitoes. Routine entomological surveillance was conducted in adjacent areas with and without ITNs from November 1999 to January 2002. Use of ITNs reduced the proportion of Anopheles gambiae Giles relative to Anopheles arabiensis Giles. The number of culicines per house was significantly lower in the ITN area than in the neighboring area. Changes in the An. gambiae sibling species distribution may help to explain apparent mosquito behavioral changes attributed to ITNs. Reductions in culicines by ITNs may have implications for community perceptions of ITN effectiveness and for control of other diseases such as lymphatic filariasis.

%X Yolk proteins (vitellogenin and vitellin) proved to be excellent marker molecules for separating Anopheles gambiae Giles and An. arabiensis Patton, two morphologically indistinguishable members of the An. gambiae species complex. A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against An. gambiae yolk proteins was made species-specific by removing immunoglobulins that crossreacted with An. arabiensis by immunoaffinity chromatography. The resultant antibody was 400 times more sensitive to An. gambiae and was employed as the secondary antibody in a modified double antibody "sandwich" ELISA, which also used monoclonal antibodies to anopheline vitellogenin as the primary or coating antibody. This ELISA easily differentiated soluble yolk protein samples from An. gambiae and An. arabiensis. A field study with 628 females of An. gambiae complex collected in western Kenya demonstrated that the ELISA results were 98.4% in agreement with the standard cytotaxonomic method.

Time Factors
%X The impact of permethrin-treated bednets on the feeding and house entering/exiting behavior of malaria vectors was assessed in two studies in western Kenya. In one study, matched pairs of houses were allocated randomly to receive bednets or no bednets. Exiting mosquitoes were collected in Colombian curtains hung around half of each house; indoor resting mosquitoes were collected by pyrethrum spray catches. The number of Anopheles gambiae Giles and An. arabiensis Patton estimated to have entered the houses was unaffected by the presence of bednets; Anopheles funestus Giles was less likely to enter a house if bednets were present. Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus were less likely to obtain a blood meal and significantly more likely to exit houses when bednets were present. No difference was detected in An. arabiensis rates of blood feeding and exiting. In a second experiment, hourly night biting collections were done on 13 nights during the rainy season to assess whether village-wide use of permethrin-treated bednets caused a shift in the time of biting of malaria vectors. A statistically significant shift was detected in the biting times of An. gambiae s.l., although the observed differences were small. No change was observed in the hourly distribution of An. funestus biting. Our study demonstrated that, at least in the short-term, bednets reduced human-vector contact and blood feeding success but did not lead to changes in the biting times of the malaria vectors in western Kenya.

%! All-cause mortality among young children in western Kenya. VI: the Asembo Bay Cohort Project
%X Although all-cause mortality has been used as an indicator of the health status of childhood populations, such data are sparse for most rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly community-based estimates of infant mortality rates. The longitudinal follow-up of more than 1,500 children enrolled at birth into the Asembo Bay Cohort Project (ABCP) in western Kenya between 1992 and 1996 has provided a fixed birth cohort for estimating all-cause mortality over the first 5 yr of life. We surveyed mothers and guardians of cohort children in early 1999 to determine survival status. A total of 1,260 households were surveyed to determine the survival status of 1,556 live births (99.2% of original cohort, n = 1,570). Most mothers (66%) still resided but 27.5% had migrated, and 5.5% had died. In early 1999, the overall cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality for the entire 1992-1996 birth cohort was 26.5% (95% confidence interval, 24.1-28.9%). Neonatal and infant mortality were 32 and 176 per 1,000 live births, respectively. These community-based estimates of mortality in the ABCP area are substantially higher than for Kenya overall (nationally, infant mortality is 75 per 1,000 live births). The results provide a baseline description of all-cause mortality among children in an area with intense Plasmodium falciparum transmission and will be useful in future efforts to monitor changes in death rates attributable to control programs for specific diseases (e.g., malaria and HIV/AIDS) in Africa.

%X The relative importance of acute high-density versus persistent low-density Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in contributing to the public health problem of malarial anemia remains unclear. The Asembo Bay Cohort Project in western Kenya collected monthly hemoglobin (Hb) and parasitologic measurements and biweekly assessments of antimalarial drug use among 942 singleton live births between 1992 and 1996. A mixed-model analysis appropriate for repeated measures data was used to study how time-varying parasitemia and antimalarial drug exposures influenced mean Hb profiles. Incidence of World Health Organization-defined severe malarial anemia was 28.1 per 1,000 person-years. Among children aged less than 24 months, concurrent parasitemia was significantly associated with lower mean Hb, especially when compared to children with no concurrent parasitemia. Increased densities of the 90-day history of parasitemia preceding Hb measurement was more strongly associated with mean Hb levels than concurrent parasitemia density. While the highest quartile of 90-day parasitemia history was associated with lowest mean Hb levels, children in the lowest 90-day exposure quartile still experienced significantly lower Hb levels when compared to children who remained parasitemia-free for the same 90-day period. The results highlight the importance of collecting and analyzing longitudinal Hb and parasitologic data when studying the natural history of malarial anemia.

%X Since 1988 malaria epidemics have occurred in multiple sites in western Kenya highlands. Climatic variability has been associated with some of the recent epidemics. We examined influences of climatic factors on the distribution and abundance of three malaria vector species, Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, and Anopheles funestus in western Kenya and in the Great Rift Valley. Mosquito samples were collected from the lowland and highland areas with various climatic conditions. The three vector species were abundant in the lower part of western Kenya. An. arabiensis was not found in the areas above 1,400 m elevation in western Kenya Although An. gambiae and An. funestus were found in the sites above 1,700 m in western Kenya, their densities were < 1 per house. In the Great Rift Valley, An. gambiae was not recorded. An. funestus was more widely distributed than the other two species. A stepwise multiple regression analysis found that moisture index was the most important variable in shaping species composition of the An. gambiae complex. Relative abundance of An. gambiae was positively associated with moisture index, suggesting that An. gambiae is more adapted to moist climate. Seasonal differences in species composition were significant in western Kenya, and the proportion of An. funestus was higher in the dry season than the rainy season. Influence of temperature on vector density was significant for all three species. These results imply that climate changes alter the distribution and abundance of malaria vectors in future.

%X Perennial and intense malaria transmission (holoendemic malaria) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are 2 cofactors in the pathogenesis of endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL). In the present study, we compared EBV loads in children living in 2 regions of Kenya with differing malaria transmission intensities: Kisumu District, where malaria transmission is holoendemic, and Nandi District, where malaria transmission is sporadic. For comparison, blood samples were also obtained from US adults, Kenyan adults, and patients with eBL. Extraction of DNA from blood and quantification by polymerase chain reaction give an EBV load estimate that reflects the number of EBV-infected B cells. We observed a significant linear trend in mean EBV load, with the lowest EBV load detected in US adults and increasing EBV loads detected in Kenyan adults, Nandi children, Kisumu children, and patients with eBL, respectively. In addition, EBV loads were significantly higher in Kisumu children 1–4 years of age than in Nandi children of the same age. Our results support the hypothesis that repeated malaria infections in very young children modulate the persistence of EBV and increase the risk for the development of eBL

%X A sampling census revealed 104 aquatic habitats of 6 types for Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in a village in western Kenya, namely burrow pits, drainage channels, livestock hoof prints, rain pools, tire tracks, and pools in streambeds. Most habitats were created by human activity and were highly clustered in dispersion pattern within the village landscape. Landscape analysis revealed that six of forty-seven 0.09 km(2) cells superimposed over the village harbored 65% of all habitats. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with villagers revealed the extent of knowledge of the village residents of larval habitats, mosquito sources in the local environment, and what might be done to prevent mosquito breeding. Participants did not associate specific habitats with anopheline larvae, expressed reluctance to eliminate habitats because they were sources of domestic water supply, but indicated willingness to participate in a source reduction program if support were available.

%X The productivity of larval habitats of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae for pupae (the stage preceding adult metamorphosis) is poorly known, yet adult emergence from habitats is the primary determinant of vector density. To assess it, we used absolute sampling methods in four studies involving daily sampling for 25 days in 6 habitat types in a village in western Kenya. Anopheles gambiae s.s. comprised 82.5% of emergent adults and Anopheles arabiensis the remainder. Pupal production occurred from a subset of habitats, primarily soil burrow pits, and was discontinuous in time, even when larvae occupied all habitats continuously. Habitat stability was positively associated with pupal productivity. In a dry season, pupal productivity was distributed between burrow pits and pools in streambeds. Overall, these data support the notion that source reduction measures against recognizably productive habitats would be a useful component of an integrated management program for An. gambiae in villages.

%X ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A supervised land cover classification was developed from very high resolution IKONOS satellite data and extensive ground truth sampling of a ca. 10 sq km malaria-endemic lowland in western Kenya. The classification was then applied to an investigation of distribution of larval Anopheles habitats. The hypothesis was that the distribution and abundance of aquatic habitats of larvae of various species of mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles is associated with identifiable landscape features. Results and discussion: The classification resulted in 7 distinguishable land cover types, each with a distinguishable vegetation pattern, was highly accurate (89%, Kappa statistic = 0.86), and had a low rate of omission and commission errors. A total of 1,198 habitats and 19,776 Anopheles larvae of 9 species were quantified in samples from a rainy season, and 184 habitats and 582 larvae from a dry season. Anopheles gambiae s.l. was the dominant species complex (51% of total) and A. arabiensis the dominant species. Agricultural land covers (mature maize fields, newly cultivated fields, and pastured grasslands) were positively associated with presence of larval habitats, and were located relatively close to stream channels; whilst nonagricultural land covers (short shrubs, medium shrubs, tall shrubs, and bare soil around residences) were negatively associated with presence of larval habitats and were more distant from stream channels. Number of larval habitats declined exponentially with distance from streams. IKONOS imagery was not useful in direct detection of larval habitats because they were small and turbid (resembling bare soil), but was useful in localization of them through statistical associations with specific land covers. Conclusion: A supervised classification of land cover types in rural, lowland, western Kenya revealed a largely human-modified and fragmented landscape consisting of agricultural and domestic land uses. Within it, larval habitats of Anopheles vectors of human malaria were associated with certain land cover types, of largely agricultural origin, and close to streams. Knowledge of these associations can inform malaria control to gather information on potential larval habitats more efficiently than by field survey and can do so over large areas.

%X Studies were carried out at three sites in the highlands of western Kenya (Iguhu and Mbale in Kakamega and Vihiga districts, respectively, and Marani in Kisii district) and at one site in the western Kenya lowlands (Kombewa in Kisumu district) to determine the spatial-temporal dynamics of malaria vectors and intensity of malaria transmission from June 2003 to June 2004. At the highland sites, Anopheles gambiae Giles predominated, constituting >80% of the vector species, whereas An. funestus Giles made up <20%. In contrast, at the lowland site, An. funestus made up 68% of the vector species. The mean annual indoor resting densities of An. gambiae at Iguhu were 5.0 female mosquitoes per house per night, 14.2- and 26.3-fold greater than those at Mbale and Marani. During the main transmission season, the indoor resting densities of An. gambiae increased 4.1-, 10.1-, and 5.0-fold over the dry season period in Iguhu, Mbale, and Marani, respectively. The estimated annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) at Iguhu was 16.6 infectious bites per person per year (ib/p/yr), 1.1 at Mbale, and 0.4 at Marani. This suggests high spatial variation in vector abundance and malaria transmission intensity. At the lowland site, Kombewa, the total annual EIR was 31.1 ib/p/yr and the indoor resting densities during the transmission season increased 7.1-fold in An. funestus and 18.5-fold in An. gambiae sensu lato over the dry season. The low level of transmission in the highlands suggests that it may be disrupted by vector control methods such as residual spraying.

%X Clay pots were analyzed as devices for sampling the outdoor resting fraction of Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) and other mosquito species in a rural, western Kenya. Clay pots (Anopheles gambiae resting pots, herein AgREPOTs), outdoor pit shelters, indoor pyrethrum spray collections (PSC), and Colombian curtain exit traps were compared in collections done biweekly for nine intervals from April to June 2005 in 20 housing compounds. Of 10,517 mosquitoes sampled, 4,668 An. gambiae s.l. were sampled in total of which 63% were An. gambiae s.s. (46% female) and 37% were An. arabiensis (66% female). The clay pots were useful and practical for sampling both sexes of An. gambiae s.l. Additionally, 617 An. funestus (58% female) and 5,232 Culex spp. (males and females together) were collected. Temporal changes in abundance of An. gambiae s.l. were similarly revealed by all four sampling methods, indicating that the clay pots could be used as devices to quantify variation in mosquito population density. Dispersion patterns of the different species and sexes fit well the negative binomial distribution, indicating that the mosquitoes were aggregated in distribution. Aside from providing a useful sampling tool, the AgREPOT also may be useful as a delivery vehicle for insecticides or pathogens to males and females that enter and rest in them.

%X A trial to determine the effectiveness of sisal eaves-curtains impregnated with permethrin for malaria control was conducted in the malaria holoendemic western Kenya between 1991 and 1993. Indoor resting densities of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus were reduced. by 90.9% and 93.8% respectively in protected houses, The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was reduced by 72% in the intervention village. There was no significant reduction in vector longevity or survival as shown by the sustained high sporozoite rates. Monthly bioassays for retained insecticidal potency of permethrin on the fibre indicated vector mortality rates above 95% over the period. Of 283 and 240 children followed up from the intervention and control villages, a mean malaria prevalence of 43.2% and 52.2% respectively was observed over the trial period (p < 0.01). The prevalence rose to 73.5% and 75.7% (p = 0.541) respectively ater the removal of the curtains, No significant differences were observed in the mean parasite density between the groups or between the proportions with parasite density exceeding 2,500 per mu l and with or without fever. The prevalence of splenomegaly was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control, both during (p = 0.005) and after the intervention (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean change in haematocrit at the end of the intervention, We observe that permethrin impregnated sisal curtains effectively retain permethrin, alter favourably the indoor vector density and EIR, and could provide a reduction in malaria prevalence.

%! Association of interferon-γ responses to pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine candidate antigens of Plasmodium falciparum in young Kenyan children with improved hemoglobin levels: XV. Asembo Bay Cohort Project
%X Previous studies in animal models have revealed an association between interferon-γ (IFN- γ), produced by CD8+ T cells and irradiated sporozoite-induced sterile immunity. To determine whether IFN-γ can serve as a marker of pre-erythrocytic protective immunity in individuals naturally exposed to malaria, we characterized IFN-γ and lymphocyte proliferative responses to previously defined CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from six pre-erythrocytic stage antigens in 107 children six months to two years old from a community-based birth cohort in western Kenya. We found that IFN- γ positive responders had higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels and significantly reduced prevalence of severe malarial anemia one month after the test compared with IFN- γ non-responders, suggesting that IFN- γ immune responses to these pre-erythrocytic antigens were associated with protection against malarial anemia. Children who responded by lymphocyte proliferation had a significantly longer time to first documented malaria parasitemia after birth; however, there was no correlation between the presence of lymphocyte proliferative response and higher Hb levels. We propose that IFN- γ production could be used as a potential marker of protective immunity against malaria associated anemia in young children living in malaria holoendemic areas.

%! Impact of control measures on malaria transmission and general mortality
%X This paper is an attempt to relate modifications observed in general and infant mortality rates with the dynamic changes in transmission induced by malaria control measures. The observations indicated relationships between the efficacy of control and a decrease in mortality. The daily parasitological inoculation rate was reduced from 0.00958 infective bites per individual before treatment to 0.00037 after treatment (a decrease of 96%). In two years, general mortality decreased from 23.9 to 13.5 deaths per 1000 population and infant mortality decreased from 157 to 93 per 1000 live births. This indirect benefit of malaria control deserves attention in a wider assessment of measures directed against vector-borne diseases.

%X The paracentric inversion polymorphisms of Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis populations in the Kisumu area of western Kenya were studied in relation to parameters of Plasmodium falciparum transmission. Anopheles gambiae (n = 1, 387) was polymorphic for inversions b on chromosomal arm 2R and a on arm 2L, with frequencies of the inverted arrangements of 17% and 43%, respectively. Anopheles arabiensis (n = 484) was polymorphic for inversion b on chromosomal arm 2R and a on 3R, with frequencies of the inverted arrangements of 58% and 5%, respectively. Observed karyotypic frequencies did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, indicating a condition of panmixia (i.e., random mating) for both species. The overall degree of intraspecific polymorphism was low, confirming findings from other zones of East Africa. No significant differences in inversion frequencies of either An. gambiae or An. arabiensis were observed, either between collecting sites or between similar sampling periods of consecutive years. At the same time, a stable, significant two-fold difference in Plasmodium infection rates was detected among An. gambiae carriers of different inversion karyotypes on chromosome 2. A significant non-uniform distribution of human- and bovid-fed specimens was also detected among the carriers of different 2Rb inversion karyotypes in indoor resting An. arabiensis. Relationships among inversion karyotypes of the two major malaria vectors in the An. gambiae complex and key factors affecting malaria transmission intensity emphasize that intraspecific variation could contribute significantly to the diversity and stability of malaria vectorial systems in Africa.

%X At two sites in the Kisumu area of western Kenya, the species composition of the Anopheles gambiae complex was determined by analysis of ovarian polytene chromosomes. Of 1,915 females, 26.1% were An. arabiensis Patton and 73.9% were An. gambiae Giles; one arabiensis x gambiae hybrid was identified. No major differences in the proportions of An. arabiensis and An. gambiae were observed between sites or between years. The ratio of An. arabiensis/An. gambiae was 6.7:1 (n = 231) in cow-baited traps, 0.2:1 (n = 1,525) in indoor resting samples, and 0.5:1 (n = 145) in all-night human bait catches. The proportion of An. arabiensis decreased progressively from 50.0% to 8.3% (n = 1,129) during 11 wk from September to November 1987; this change was correlated negatively with night temperature and positively with temperature range. In cow-baited traps, 97.4% (n = 194) of An. arabiensis were cow-fed and 95.8% (n = 1,054) of An. gambiae from indoor resting collections were human-fed. In indoor collections, 37.2% (n = 215) of An. arabiensis were cow-fed and 23.1% (n = 26) of An. gambiae from cow traps were human-fed. This demonstrates post-blood-feeding endophily by An. arabiensis and suggests post-blood-feeding exophily by An. gambiae. Malaria infection rates were higher for An. gambiae than for An. arabiensis by a ratio of 3:1 in 1986 (by Plasmodium falciparum ELISA) and 2.3:1 in 1987 (by dissection). Despite the higher proportion of infective An. gambiae, both species in this area serve as efficient vectors through their remarkably stable contact with the human population as demonstrated by their blood feeding and resting behavior.

%! Efficacy of permethrin-treated bed nets in the prevention of mortality in young children in an area of high perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya
%X A group-randomized controlled trial of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) was conducted in an area of high perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya to test the effect of ITNs on all-cause mortality in children 1-59 months of age. Child deaths were monitored over a two-year period by biannual household census in Asembo (1997-1998) and in Gem (1998-1999). Overall, 1,722 deaths occurred in children 1-59 months followed for 35,932 child-years. Crude mortality rates/1,000 child-years were 51.9 versus 43.9 in control and ITN villages in children 1-59 months old. The protective efficacy (PE) (95% confidence interval) adjusted for age, study year, study site, and season was 16% (6-25%). Corresponding figures in 1-11- and 12-59-month-old children in control and ITN villages were 133.3 versus 102.3, PE = 23% (11-34%) and 31.1 versus 28.7, PE = 7% (-6-19%). The numbers of lives saved/1,000 child-years were 8, 31, and 2 for the groups 1-59, 1-11, and 12-59 months old, respectively. Stratified analysis by time to insecticide re-treatment showed that the PE of ITNs re-treated per study protocol (every six months) was 20% (10-29%), overall and 26% (12-37%) and 14% (-1-26%) in 1-11- and 12-59-month-old children, respectively. ITNs prevent approximately one in four infant deaths in areas of intense perennial malaria transmission, but their efficacy is compromised if re-treatment is delayed beyond six months.

The SCVs were monitored over a four-year period both before (1995–1996) and during the intervention (1997–1998). Results are used to estimate the effect of ITNs on the burden of malaria in this community and to evaluate the potential role of these facilities in assessment of the impact of large-scale public health interventions. Compared with baseline, a 27% greater reduction in the incidence of SCVs was seen in ITN villages than in control villages (37% versus 10%; P = 0.049). A similar reduction was observed in SCVs diagnosed as malaria (35% reduction in ITN villages versus 5% reduction in controls; P = 0.04). Two-hundred sixteen SCVs per 1,000 child-years were prevented; three-fourths of these were in children less than 24 months old. As a consequence of lack of laboratory facilities, severe anemia was rarely (< 2%) diagnosed, regardless of intervention status. No effect of ITNs on the incidence of respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and other commonly diagnosed childhood illnesses was observed. The ITNs reduced the number of SCVs due to malaria, but had no effect on other illnesses. Routine statistics from these facilities provided useful information on trends in malaria incidence, but underestimated the burden of severe anemia.

%! The efficacy of permethrin-treated bed nets on child mortality and morbidity in western Kenya II. Study design and methods
%X This paper describes the study design and methods used in a large community-based, group-randomized, controlled trial of permethrin-treated bed nets (ITNs) in an area with intense, perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya conducted between 1996 and 1999. A multi-disciplinary framework was used to explore the efficacy of ITNs in the reduction of all-cause mortality in children less than five years old, the clinical, entomologic, immunologic, and economic impact of ITNs, the social and behavioral determinants of ITN use, and the use of a geographic information system to allow for spatial analyses of these outcomes. Methodologic difficulties encountered in such large-scale field trials are discussed.

%! Diagnostic and prescribing practices in peripheral health facilities in rural western Kenya
%X Health facility ledgers of 11 rural health facilities in western Kenya were reviewed to evaluate diagnostic and prescribing practices. Clinics lacked laboratory facilities. Of 14,267 sick child visits (SCVs), 76% were diagnosed with malaria and/or upper respiratory infections. Other diagnoses were recorded in less than 5% of SCVs. Although two-thirds of malaria cases were diagnosed with co-infections, less than 3% were concomitantly diagnosed with anemia. Chloroquine and penicillin constituted 94% of prescriptions. Half of children given a sole diagnosis of measles or pneumonia were prescribed chloroquine, and 22% of children with a sole diagnosis of malaria were given penicillin. Antimalarials other than chloroquine were rarely prescribed. Only 12% of children diagnosed with anemia were prescribed iron supplementation, while 53% received folic acid. This study highlights limited diagnostic and prescribing practices and a lack of adherence to national treatment guidelines in rural western Kenya.

%X Population genetic structure and subdivision are key factors affecting the evolution of organisms. In this study, we analysed and compared the population genetic structure of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae over space and time in the Nianza Province, near Victoria Lake in Kenya. The parasites were collected from mosquitoes caught in six villages separated by up to 68km in 2002 and 2003. A total of 545 oocysts were dissected from 122 infected mosquitoes and genotyped at seven microsatellite markers. Five hundred and forty-seven mosquitoes, both infected and uninfected, were genotyped at eight microsatellites. For the parasite and the vector, the analysis revealed no (or very little) genetic differentiation among villages. This may be explained by high local population sizes for the parasite and the mosquito. The small level of genetic differentiation observed between populations may explain the speed at which antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance spread into the African continent.

%X The population genetic structure of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of malignant malaria, has been shown to be predominantly "clonal" (i.e., highly inbred) in regions of low infectivity; in high-infectivity regions, it is often thought to be panmictic, or nearly so, although there is little supporting evidence for this. The matter can be settled by investigating the parasite's genetic makeup in the midgut oocysts of the mosquito vector, where the products of meiosis can directly be observed. The developmental stages of P. falciparum are haploid, except in the oocysts of infected mosquito vectors, where two gametes fuse, diploidy occurs, and meiosis ensues. We have investigated genetic polymorphisms at seven microsatellite loci located on five chromosomes by assaying 613 oocysts in 145 mosquitoes sampled from 11 localities of Kenya, where malignant malaria is perennial and intense. There is considerable allelic variation, 16.3 +/- 2.1 alleles per locus, and considerable inbreeding, approximately 50% on the average. The inbreeding is caused by selfing (approximately 25%) and nonrandom genotype distribution of oocysts among mosquito guts (35%). The observed frequency of heterozygotes is 0.43 +/- 0.03; the expected frequency, assuming random mating, is 0.80 +/- 0.05. Linkage disequilibrium is statistically significant for all 21 pairwise comparisons between loci, even though 19 comparisons are between loci in different chromosomes, which is consistent with strong deviation from panmixia and the consequent reproduction of genomes as clones, without recombination between gene loci. This is of considerable evolutionary significance and of epidemiological consequence, concerning the spread of multilocus drug and vaccine resistance.

%X Here we report the discovery of a novel family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons designated mtanga-Y, specific to the Y chromosome of the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. mtanga-Y elements represent the first Y-linked sequences and the first members of the Ty1-copia superfamily of retrotransposons described from this mosquito. Analysis of a full-length 4,284-bp element revealed the presence of two intact overlapping open reading frames bounded by LTRs of 119 bp. Evidence suggests that the elements are capable of retrotransposition, as transcripts and potential replication intermediates (one-LTR circles) were detected. However, the similar to12 copies of mtanga-Y appear to be clustered rather than dispersed on the Y chromosome. Absent from the Y chromosome of four sibling species (A. arabiensis, A. quadriannulatus, A. melas, and A. merus), similar, but often defective, mtanga elements are present elsewhere in these genomes, as well as in A. gambiae. These data are consistent with a relatively recent invasion of the A. gambiae Y chromosome by an intact element. The presence of functional mtanga-Y elements suggests that the Y chromosome may be a source, not just a sink, for retrotransposons.

%X We present evidence that a parasite with characteristics of Plasmodium vivax is being transmitted among Duffy blood group-negative inhabitants of Kenya. Thirty-two of 4,901 Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus (0.65%) collected in Nyanza Province were ELISA positive for the P. vivax circumsporozoite protein VK 247. All positives were found late in the rainy season, when An. funestus predominated, and disproportionately many were found at a single village. A P. vivax specific sequence of the SSU rRNA gene was amplified from three of six ELISA-positive mosquitoes. Erythrocytes from 31 children, including 9 microscopically diagnosed as infected with P. vivax, were negative by flow cytometry for the Fy3 or Fy6 epitopes, which indicate Duffy blood group expression. A DNA fragment specific for the C terminus of the gene for P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) was amplified from the blood of four of these children and subsequently sequenced from two.

%X We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA profiling to determine the person from whom Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae collected in natural human habitations obtained their blood meals. Less than 20% of human hosts contributed to > 50% of all blood meals, and 42% were not bitten at all, including people in the age group bitten most often. As expected, bites were unevenly distributed by age (young adults > older adults > children). Use of untreated bed nets by adults, but not children, seemed to redirect bites to children. Multiple blood meals in a single gonotrophic cycle occurred frequently enough to be epidemiologically important (14% for An. funestus and 11% for An. gambiae). Mosquitoes that did not bite a person who slept in the collection house can affect estimation of entomological risk. Mosquito-human interactions did not differ across ecologically and epidemiologically distinct highland and lowland sites.

%X The effectiveness of permethrin-impregnated (0.5 g/m2) bed-nets and curtains as malaria control measures was evaluated in Uriri, Kenya in 1988. One hundred five families were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups (control, bed-net, or curtain). All participants were cured of parasitemia with pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine. Selective epidemiologic and entomologic parameters were measured weekly, while knowledge, attitude, and practices surveys were conducted at the beginning and end of the 15 week study. Plasmodium falciparum infections per person week at risk were significantly higher in the control group than in either the curtain group (5.42 vs. 2.35 cases/100 person weeks risk) or the bed-net group (5.42 vs. 3.77 cases/100 person weeks risk). The curtain group had fewer infections per person week at risk than the bed-net group (2.35 vs. 3.77 cases/100 person weeks risk). A difference was found in clinical malaria among the groups: 45% of persons in the bed-net and curtain groups vs. 30% of those in the control group reported no episodes of fever and chills (chi 2, P less than 0.05). Indoor resting Anopheles gambiae or An. funestus were found on 94 occasions in the control houses, but only twice in the treated houses during weekly visits to each house over the study period (chi 2 P less than 0.001). The pyrethrum knockdown method produced similar results with a total of 195, 23, and 3 An. gambiae and An. funestus collected in the control, bed-net, and curtain houses during the same period, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

%X OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of live potted plants and thermal expulsion of plant materials in repelling African malaria vectors in traditional houses in western Kenya. METHODS: Ocimum americanum, Lantana camara and Lippia ukambensis were tested in live, intact potted form whereas leaves of Corymbia citriodora, leaves and seeds of O. kilimandscharicum and O. suave were tested by thermal expulsion from modified traditional stoves. A latin square design was applied for randomly assigning the treatment and control plants to experimental houses over different nights. RESULTS: All plant species showed significant repellency against Anopheles gambiae sensu lato Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) (81.5%An. arabiensis Patton and 18.5%An. gambiae sensu stricto Giles), the main vectors of malaria in Africa, with the highest repellency by C. citriodora (48.71%, P < 0.0001) followed by an equal level of repellency of O. kilimandscharicum and O. suave (44.54%, P = 0.001) during application of plant material by thermal expulsion. All three plant species also showed a residual effect against An. gambiae s.l. with 36-44% repellency post-application period (22.30-06.30 hours) after a period of thermal expulsion. Similarly, intact potted plants of O. americanum and L. camara repelled An. gambiae s.l. significantly (37.91%, P = 0.004; and 27.22%, P = 0.05, respectively). Thermal expulsion of leaves and seeds of O. kilimandscharicum significantly repelled An. funestus Giles, although none of the potted plants repelled this species. CONCLUSION: Both methods of application may offer cost-effective alternatives as additional means of household protection, and a useful complement to bed nets, particularly for the early part of the evening before bedtime.

%R 10.1086/320999
%X In vitro studies have shown that inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage parasite growth by antibody-dependent cellular inhibition is mediated by cooperation between malaria-specific IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2, and monocytes via the Fcγ receptor II (FcγRII). A single amino acid substitution at position 131 in FcγRIIa is critical in the binding of human IgG subclasses. The hypothesis that the FcγRIIa-Arg/Arg131 genotype, which does not bind to IgG2, is a host genetic factor for protection against high-density P. falciparum infection was tested. One hundred eighty-two infants from a large community-based birth cohort study in western Kenya were selected for an unmatched case-control study. Results showed that the infants with the FcγRIIa-Arg/Arg131 genotype were significantly less likely to be at risk for high-density falciparum infection, compared with infants with the FcγRIIa-His/Arg131 genotype (adjusted odds ratio, 0.278; 95% confidence interval, 0.123–0.627; P=.0021). This finding supports the hypothesis

%! Natural immune response to the C-terminal 19-kilodalton domain of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1
%X We have characterized the natural immune responses to the 19-kDa domain of merozoite surface protein 1 in individuals from an area of western Kenya in which malaria is holoendemic. We used the three known natural variant forms of the yeast-expressed recombinant 19-kDa fragment that are referred to as the E-KNG, Q-KNG, and E-TSR antigens. T-cell proliferative responses in individuals older than 15 years and the profile of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody isotypes in individuals from 2 to 74 years old were determined. Positive proliferative responses to the Q-KNG antigen were observed for 54% of the individuals, and 37 and 35% of the individuals responded to the E-KNG and E-TSR constructs, respectively. Considerable heterogeneity in the T-cell proliferative responses to these three variant antigens was observed in different individuals, suggesting that the 19-kDa antigen may contain variant-specific T epitopes. Among responses of the different isotypes of the IgG antibody, IgG1 and IgG3 isotype responses were predominant, and the prevalence and levels of the responses increased with age. We also found that a higher level of IgG1 antibody response correlated with lower parasite density among young age groups, suggesting that IgG1 antibody response may play a role in protection against malaria. However, there was no correlation between the IgG3 antibody level and protection. Furthermore, we observed that although the natural antibodies cross-reacted with all three variant 19-kDa antigens, IgG3 antibodies in 12 plasma samples recognized only the E-KNG and Q-KNG constructs and not the E-TSR antigen. This result suggests that the fine specificity of IgG3 antibodies differentiates among variant-specific natural B-cell determinants in the second epidermal growth factor domain (KNG and TSR) of the antigen.

%X Genetic variation in defensin, a gene encoding a major effector molecule of insects immune response was analyzed within and between populations of three members of the Anopheles gambiae complex. The species selected included the two anthropophilic species, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis and the most zoophilic species of the complex, An. quadriannulatus. The first species was represented by four populations spanning its extreme genetic and geographical ranges, whereas each of the other two species was represented by a single population. We found (i) reduced overall polymorphism in the mature peptide region and in the total coding region, together with specific reductions in rare and moderately frequent mutations (sites) in the coding region compared with non-coding regions, (ii) markedly reduced rate of non-synonymous diversity compared with synonymous variation in the mature peptide and virtually identical mature peptide across the three species, and (iii) increased divergence between species in the mature peptide together with reduced differentiation between populations of An. gambiae in the same DNA region. These patterns suggest a strong purifying selection on the mature peptide and probably the whole coding region. Because An. quadriannulatus is not exposed to human pathogens, identical mature peptide and similar pattern of polymorphism across species implies that human pathogens played no role as selective agents on this peptide.

%R 10.1086/375241
%X In areas of intense malaria transmission, malaria morbidity and mortality is highest in children 3–18 months old. Interventions that reduce malaria exposure early in life reduce morbidity but may also delay development of clinical immunity. We assessed the relationship between intensity of malaria exposure and development of antibody responses. Thirty-nine children were monitored monthly, from birth to ⩾2.5 years old (1238 observations), and were divided into 3 exposure categories, on the basis of parasitemic episodes or entomological data. Children with low exposure during the first 2 years of life had higher subsequent levels of antibody to merozoite surface protein-119-kDa (a marker of blood-stage responses) by months 24–35 (P<.05). This inverse relationship decreased as children aged. There was no consistent relationship between exposure early in life and subsequent levels of antibody to circumsporozoite protein (a marker of sporozoite-stage responses). These data suggest that, in areas of intense malaria transmission, during the first 3 years of life, interventions that either reduce the number of asexual parasitemic episodes or lower entomological exposure do not delay the development of antibody responses to blood-stage malarial antigens

%X BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Africa. Many approaches to malaria control involve reducing the chances of infection but little is known of the relations between parasite exposure and the development of effective clinical immunity so the long-term effect of such approaches to control on the pattern and frequency of malaria cannot be predicted. METHODS: We have prospectively recorded paediatric admissions with severe malaria over three to five years from five discrete communities in The Gambia and Kenya. Demographic analysis of the communities exposed to disease risk allowed the estimation of age-specific rates for severe malaria. Within each community the exposure to Plasmodium falciparum infection was determined through repeated parasitological and serological surveys among children and infants. We used acute respiratory-tract infections (ARI) as a comparison. FINDINGS: 3556 malaria admissions were recorded for the five sites. Marked differences were observed in age, clinical spectrum and rates of severe malaria between the five sites. Paradoxically, the risks of severe disease in childhood were lowest among populations with the highest transmission intensities, and the highest disease risks were observed among populations exposed to low-to-moderate intensities of transmission. For severe malaria, for example, admission rates (per 1000 per year) for children up to their 10th birthday were estimated as 3.9, 25.8, 25.9, 16.7, and 18.0 in the five communities; the forces of infection estimated for those communities (new infections per infant per month) were 0.001, 0.034, 0.050, 0.093, and 0.176, respectively. Similar trends were noted for cerebral malaria and for severe malaria anaemia but not for ARI. Mean age of disease decreased with increasing transmission intensity. INTERPRETATION: We propose that a critical determinant of life-time disease risk is the ability to develop clinical immunity early in life during a period when other protective mechanisms may operate. In highly endemic areas measures which reduce parasite transmission, and thus immunity, may lead to a change in both the clinical spectrum of severe disease and the overall burden of severe malaria morbidity.

%@ 0003-4983
%X Mortality and fertility rates were measured from 1981 to 1983 by prospective registration of vital events as part of a community-based malaria control and health development programme in Saradidi, Kenya. There was no obvious effect of providing chloroquine phosphate for treatment of malaria in each village on mortality or fertility rates. Crude death rates were 13.1 in the year before intervention (1 May 1981 to 30 April 1982) and 12.3 after intervention (1 September 1982 to 31 August 1983). Neonatal mortality increased from 36.8 per 1000 live births pre-intervention to 49.1 during intervention. There was a slight decline in post-neonatal (one to 12 months) mortality (72.8 to 67.0) and a significant drop in early childhood mortality (25.2 to 18.2). The change in mortality rates in these two age groups were fully explained by a high rate of measles mortality in the pre-intervention period. Measles accounted for 35.7% of 284 reported deaths in infants one to 12 months of age and for 40.9% of 230 deaths in children one to four years old. There was little change in reported malaria-specific mortality rates in infants and young children most likely because of a high level of chloroquine use for treatment of presumptive illness. Perinatal mortality by area ranged between 60.4 and 81.3 pre-intervention to 79.5 to 97.2 after the control programme was instituted. Crude birth rates by area remained stable at about 40 and general fertility rates were about 200. Both pre-intervention and during intervention infants were significantly more likely to have died without medical consultation than children one to four years. However, 79.2% of 284 infants and 90.7% of 193 children died in spite of having consulted a health worker prior to death. The data suggest that a measles vaccine programme would significantly reduce mortality rates in infants and young children. The fact that the majority of infants and young children died in spite of receiving medical attention indicates both the inadequacy of curative medical services in this high mortality setting as well as the necessity for promoting preventive health measures.

%@ 0003-4983
%X A census was done in Saradidi, Kenya from 1980 to 1982 as part of a community-based health development programme. The population was 42,755 (excluding 39 persons of unknown age or sex); 17.1% were less than five years old, 46.9% were below age 15, 4.7% were age 65 years or older and 19.7% were women in the reproductive years (age 15 to 44 years). The sex ratio was 86 males per 100 females due principally to migration of adult males for work. The mean number of persons per household was 4.0 and the mean village population was 764. The singulate mean age of marriage for men was 27.0 years and for women 19.9 years; 0.8% of adult men had never married. Only 0.1% of women by age 50 had never been married. Men were significantly more likely than women to be married to more than one spouse, divorce and separation was higher among men, and by age 50 about one-third of women were widows. Men had more years of formal education than women and young people of both sexes more than older people; 73.1% of men and 96.1% of women 60 years and more had never attended school. Infant mortality rates estimated indirectly ranged between 139 and 155 by area. A strong association was found between increasing education of the mother and decreased reported mortality of children. The total fertility of 6.2 was high but lower than the national average possibly because of the high rates of polygamy and primary infertility and the long periods of amenorrhoea and breast feeding which occurred after delivery. This area continues to have one of the highest levels of infant and child mortality in Kenya as well as relatively high fertility and a population with a very young age structure. This implies a continued very rapid rate of population growth which will make more difficult in the future the problems of delivering effective health services and overcoming poverty. A vigorous programme directed toward improving health is indicated which must include family planning.

%! In vivo response of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine in pregnant and non-pregnant women in Siaya District, Kenya
%X Chemoprophylaxis using chloroquine (CQ) in suppressive doses has been recommended to protect pregnant women in malarious areas from the adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy. In a malaria-endemic area of western Kenya with CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, we determined the prevalence and density of falciparum infection in gravid and nulligravid women and compared the in-vivo parasite response to CQ using two regimens: 25 mg/kg body weight (CQ25) divided over a period of three days (for high-density parasitaemias) and 5 mg/kg body weight (CQ5) weekly for 4 weeks (for low-density parasitaemias). P. falciparum infections were present in 102 (42%) of 244 pregnant women. A greater proportion of primigravidae were parasitaemic (68%) than nulligravidae (50%, P=0.02) or multigravidae (33%, P <10-6). Primigravidae showed a higher geometric mean parasite density. In the CQ25 treatment group, failure to clear parasites by day 7 was more common in primigravidae than nulligravidae (P=0.008) or multigravidae (P=0.15). In the CQ5 treatment group, primigravidae were more likely to show increasing parasite density than nulligravidae or multigravidae.

In this area of Kenya, virtually all women in their first pregnancy are exposed to malaria and are at greatest risk for malaria infection; compared with other women, they show higher parasite densities and are least likely to respond to chloroquine treatment in areas of chloroquine resistance. Malaria control strategies might be targeted to this group of women, but we are pessimistic about the efficacy of weekly CQ5 where there is chloroquine resistance.

%X Permethrin and DDT resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s. associated with a leucine-serine knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was discovered recently in western Kenya where a large scale permethrin-impregnated bed net (ITN) program has been implemented. Collections of An. gambiae s.l. were made from intervention and control villages prior to and after onset of the program. The kdr genotypes were determined using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests. In An. gambiae s.s., the frequency of the kdr mutation prior to ITN introduction was approximately 3-4% in western Kenya and zero in samples from the coast. After ITN introduction, the kdr mutation increased in ITN and neighboring villages from approximately 4% to approximately 8%, but remained unchanged in villages at least 20 km distant and was not detected in coastal Kenya. The identical leucine-serine mutation was found in a single An. arabiensis individual among 658 tested. The leucine-phenylalanine kdr mutation common in west African An. gambiae populations was not detected in An. gambiae s.l. from Kenya. Implications for the population structure and control of An. gambiae are discussed.

%X We have investigated intragenic recombination in Block 2 of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), where three allele-specific families: K1, Mad20, and RO33 were previously known. Using parasites from western Kenya, we have found a fourth Block 2 allele type, which is a recombinant between Mad20 and RO33 alleles. These recombinant alleles, which we have termed MR, contain sequence from the 5′ region of Mad20 and the 3′ region of RO33. The results of this study provide new data on the complexity of the MSP-1 antigen gene, which is a candidate vaccine antigen, and further support the importance of intragenic recombination in generating genetic variability in Plasmodium falciparum parasites in nature.

%X Mosquitoes collected monthly for 1 year from human habitations in the Kisumu area of western Kenya were identified by morphological characters as Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato (An. gambiae s.l.) or An. funestus. Of the mosquitoes collected, 7,244 (67%) of the An. gambiae s.l. and 8,511 (87%) of the An. funestus were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein. ELISA positivity rates were 8.2% for An. gambiae s.l. and 6.1% for An. funestus. Both An. gambiae and An. arabiensis were detected among 432 ELISA-positive and 668 ELISA-negative An. gambiae s.l. identified to species with a ribosomal DNA probe. The species-specific infection rates were calculated to be 9.6% for An. gambiae and 0.4% for An. arabiensis. These results confirm that An. gambiae and An. funestus are the primary malaria vectors in western Kenya and that An. arabiensis is a relatively minor vector.

%! Impact of permethrin-treated bed nets on malaria, anemia, and growth in infants in an area of intense perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya
%X As part of a community-based, group-randomized, controlled trial of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) in an area with intense malaria transmission in western Kenya, a birth cohort (n = 833) was followed monthly until the age of 24 months to determine the potential beneficial and adverse effects of reduced malaria exposure during pregnancy and infancy. Malaria transmission and morbidity were comparable pre-intervention. The ITNs reduced malaria attack rates (force of infection) in infancy by 74%, and delayed the median time-to-first parasitemia (4.5 to 10.7 months; P < 0.0001). The incidence of both clinical malaria and moderate-severe anemia (hemoglobin level <7 g/dL) were reduced by 60% (P < 0.001 for both). Protective efficacy was greatest in infants less than three months old and similar in older infants and one-year-old children. Efficacy was lowest in the dry season. Infants from ITN villages experienced better height and weight gain. In areas of intense perennial malaria transmission, ITNs substantially reduce exposure to malaria and subsequent malaria-associated morbidity in children less than 24 months old. Reduced malaria exposure during infancy did not result, with continued ITN use, in increased malaria morbidity in one-year-old children.

%! Reduction of malaria during pregnancy by permethrin-treated bed nets in an area of intense perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya
%X The impact of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) on malaria in pregnancy was studied in a rural area in western Kenya with intense perennial malaria transmission. All households in 40 of 79 villages were randomized to receive ITNs by January 1997. The ITNs were distributed in control villages two years later. Complete data on birth outcome were available on 2,754 (89.6%) of 3,072 deliveries. Women (n = 780) were followed monthly throughout pregnancy in 19 of 79 villages. Among gravidae 1–4, ITNs were associated with reductions of 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17–54%) in the incidence of malaria parasitemia and 47% (95% CI = 6–71%) in the incidence of severe malarial anemia (hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL with parasitemia) during pregnancy. At the time of delivery, mean hemoglobin levels were 0.6 g/dL (95% CI = 0.01–1.2 g/dL) higher, the prevalence of placental or maternal malaria was reduced by 35% (95% CI = 20–47%), and the prevalence of low birth weight was reduced by 28% (95% CI = 2–47%) in gravidae 1–4 from ITN villages. No beneficial impact was observed in gravidae five or higher. In areas of intense perennial malaria transmission, permethrin-treated bed nets reduce the adverse effect of malaria during the first four pregnancies.

%X Information on the impact of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) from randomized controlled trials in areas of intense perennial malaria transmission is limited. As part of a large-scale, community-based, group-randomized controlled trial of the effect of ITNs on childhood mortality in a holoendemic area in western Kenya, we conducted three cross-sectional surveys in 60 villages to assess the impact of ITNs on morbidity in 1,890 children less than three years old. Children in ITN and control villages were comparable pre-intervention, but after the introduction of ITNs, children in intervention villages were less likely to have recently experienced illness requiring treatment (protective efficacy [95% confidence intervals] = 15% [1–26%]), have an enlarged spleen (32% [20–43%]), be parasitemic (19% [11–27%]), have clinical malaria (44% [6–66%]), have moderately severe anemia (hemoglobin level < 7.0 g/dL; 39% [18–54%]), or have a pruritic body rash, presumably from reduced nuisance insect bites (38% [24–50%]). Use of ITNs was also associated with significantly higher mean weight-for-age Z-scores and mid-upper arm circumferences. There was no evidence, however, that ITNs reduced the risk of helminth infections, diarrhea, or upper or lower respiratory tract infections. The ITNs substantially reduced malaria-associated morbidity and improved weight gain in young children in this area of intense perennial malaria transmission.

%X The role of the sickle cell hemoglobin type as a determinant of treatment outcome with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was retrospectively studied in young children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria who lived in an area with intense perennial malaria transmission. Between 1993 and 1997, 2795 treatments involving 813 children were monitored. Sickle cell trait (HbAS) was present in 17.7% of the children. Two-and-a-half percent of the children experienced early clinical treatment failure by day 2–3, and 17.3% of the children were parasitemic on day 7. Treatments in HbAS children were less likely than those in HbAA children to result in persistence of parasitemia by day 3 (relative risk [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47–0.93; P=.02) or in parasitologic treatment failure on day 7 (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36–0.71; P<.0001). These results suggest that the HbAS phenotype should be included among factors that determine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment outcome

%R 10.1086/367705
%X This study retrospectively studied amendable determinants of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) efficacy involving 2869 treatments among 1072 Kenyan children <5 years old who had uncomplicated malaria. The dose was based on age: one-quarter tablet was given to infants <1 year old, one-half tablet was given to 1–3-year-old children, and a full tablet was given to 4-year-old children. Only 23.5% received the internationally recommended target dose of 25/1.25 mg of SP per kg of body weight. SP intake in the previous 15–35 days (adjusted relative risk, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.35–2.07) and low SP dose (<27.5/1.375 mg/kg) (adjusted relative risk, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–2.13) explained 38% of parasitological treatment failures by day 7. Patients with recent SP intake are likely to have recrudescent infections and may need close follow-up if treated with SP or alternative treatment. Applying our weight-for-age data to 31 existing age-based SP dose recommendations predicted that 22 of them would result in underdosing of >25% of children <5 years. Many age-based dose recommendations need urgent revision, because SP is increasingly used as first-line treatment in sub-Saharan Africa

%R 10.1128/aac.47.9.2929-2932.2003
%X Between 1993 and 1999, we monitored the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in 1,175 children aged <24 months receiving 2,789 treatments for falciparum malaria in western Kenya using a widely deployed age-based dose regimen: infants, 125 plus 6.25 mg (sulfadoxine plus pyrimethamine); children aged 12 to 23 months; 250 plus 12.5 mg. Cumulative treatment failure by day 7, defined as early clinical failure by day 3 or presence of parasitemia on day 7, increased from 18% in 1993 to 1994 to 22% in 1997 to 1998 (P-trend test = 0.20). Based on body weight, the median dose received was 20 plus 1.00 mg/kg, and 73% of the treatments were given at lower than the recommended target dose of 25 plus 1.25 mg/kg. Underdosing accounted for 26% of cumulative treatment failures. After the dose was increased in 1998 (median, 36 plus 1.8 mg/kg), only 4.2% of patients received less than 25 plus 1.25 mg/kg and there was no association with treatment failure. However, the proportion of cumulative treatment failure continued to increase to 27% by 1999 (P-trend test = 0.03). These results raise concern about the longevity of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in these settings. Underdosing may have contributed to the rate at which sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance developed in this area. Treatment guidelines should ensure that adequate doses are given from the initial deployment of antimalarials onward.

%! Longitudinal study of natural immune responses to the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen (AMA-1) in a holoendemic region of malaria in western Kenya: Asembo Bay Cohort Project VIII
%X We investigated the development and maintenance of proliferative and antibody responses to apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) epitopes in a holoendemic area of western Kenya. Young children (< 10 years), older children (10-17 years), and adults (> or = 18 years) were followed longitudinally for antibody and T-cell responses at 3 time points with an interval of 3-4 months. The proliferative responses against the AMA-1 T epitopes (PL171, PL172, PL173, PL186, PL191, and PL192) were not stable during follow-up; however, response to mycobacterial antigen PPD was highly stable. The responder frequencies were similar in all 3 time points except for epitope PL192. The younger and older children responded more frequently to T-cell epitopes, but the differences were not significant. A positive proliferative response to PL191 was associated with a significantly lower risk of parasitemia at subsequent follow-up (relative risk, 0.5; P = 0.03). The presence of antibody response to B epitopes PL169, PL170, PL173, PL187, and PL192 in one time point was associated with a subsequent response (P = 0.0001-0.008) suggesting a stable response. Younger (P = 0.046) and older children (P = 0.017) more frequently responded to epitope PL169 than did adults, and adults responded more frequently to PL187 than did younger children (P = 0.009). Responses to AMA-1 T-cell epitopes were short lived, and antibody responses were relatively stable.

%X Laboratory colonies of the human malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae Giles and An. arabiensis Patton have distinct flight tones. If flight tone similarly distinguishes natural populations of these sympatric sibling species, it may play a role in reproductive isolation of swarms that are otherwise behaviourally identical. To assess the fidelity of flight tone differences in natural populations, flight tone was measured in the Fl progeny of mosquitoes of both species captured in western Kenya. Flight tone distributions of wild An. gambiae and An. arabiensis were similar to their laboratory conspecifics. However, interspecies comparisons of flight tone of wild mosquitoes revealed significantly different but overlapping distributions for both sexes. Furthermore, when the effect of body size on flight tone was determined, there was a positive correlation between wing length and flight tone for both sexes of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, suggesting that mosquito size is a significant variable affecting flight tone. Although these findings diminish any practical benefit of flight tone as a diagnostic tool in species identification, its potential role in pre-mating species recognition needs further investigation.

%X Feeding behavior was compared between infected and uninfected field-collected groups of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and An. funestus from western Kenya. A significantly greater percentage (81%) of Plasmodium falciparum-infected An. gambiae s.l. females probed on experimental hosts (hamsters) than did uninfected females (38%). Among those females that initiated probing, there was no effect of infection status on the ability to take a bloodmeal. Plasmodium falciparum-infected An. gambiae s.l. probed more often (mean = 4.0) and for a longer time (mean = 277 sec) than did their uninfected counterparts (mean = 2.4 probes and mean probing time = 214 sec). Results for the small number of An. funestus that fed followed the same trend. Among infected An. gambiae s.l. females, there was no effect of sporozoite density on either the number of probes made or the total probing time. Among uninfected females, there was no difference in feeding behavior between nulliparous and parous females. In laboratory experiments, female age had no effect on blood-feeding behavior. Our findings provide evidence that natural malaria infection modifies the feeding behavior of Anopheles females.

%! The cost-effectiveness of permethrin-treated bed nets in an area of intense malaria transmission in western Kenya
%X This study compared the costs and effects of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed net (ITN) use in children less than five years of age in an area of intense, perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya. The data were derived from a group-randomized controlled trial of ITNs conducted between 1996 and 1999. The annual net cost per life-year gained was U.S. $34 and the net annual cost per all-cause sick child clinic visit averted was U.S. $49. After taking into account a community effect (protection from malaria afforded to non-ITN users who lived within 300 meters from users) these estimates decreased to U.S. $25 and U.S. $38, respectively. This study provides further evidence that ITNs are a highly cost-effective use of scarce health care resources.

%@ 1475-2875
%M doi:10.1186/1475-2875-12-143
%X BACKGROUND:Operational vector sampling methods lack standardization, making quantitative comparisons of malaria transmission across different settings difficult. Human landing catch (HLC) is considered the research gold standard for measuring human-mosquito contact, but is unsuitable for large-scale sampling. This study assessed mosquito catch rates of CDC light trap (CDC-LT), Ifakara tent trap (ITT), window exit trap (WET), pot resting trap (PRT), and box resting trap (BRT) relative to HLC in western Kenya to 1) identify appropriate methods for operational sampling in this region, and 2) contribute to a larger, overarching project comparing standardized evaluations of vector trapping methods across multiple countries.METHODS:Mosquitoes were collected from June to July 2009 in four districts: Rarieda, Kisumu West, Nyando, and Rachuonyo. In each district, all trapping methods were rotated 10 times through three houses in a 3 x 3 Latin Square design. Anophelines were identified by morphology and females classified as fed or non-fed. Anopheles gambiae s.l. were further identified as Anopheles gambiae s.s. or Anopheles arabiensis by PCR. Relative catch rates were estimated by negative binomial regression.RESULTS:When data were pooled across all four districts, catch rates (relative to HLC indoor) for An. gambiae s.l (95.6% An. arabiensis, 4.4% An. gambiae s.s) were high for HLC outdoor (RR = 1.01), CDC-LT (RR = 1.18), and ITT (RR = 1.39); moderate for WET (RR = 0.52) and PRT outdoor (RR = 0.32); and low for all remaining types of resting traps (PRT indoor, BRT indoor, and BRT outdoor; RR < 0.08 for all). For Anopheles funestus, relative catch rates were high for ITT (RR = 1.21); moderate for HLC outdoor (RR = 0.47), CDC-LT (RR = 0.69), and WET (RR = 0.49); and low for all resting traps (RR < 0.02 for all). At finer geographic scales, however, efficacy of each trap type varied from district to district.CONCLUSIONS:ITT, CDC-LT, and WET appear to be effective methods for large-scale vector sampling in western Kenya. Ultimately, choice of collection method for operational surveillance should be driven by trap efficacy and scalability, rather than fine-scale precision with respect to HLC. When compared with recent, similar trap evaluations in Tanzania and Zambia, these data suggest that traps which actively lure host-seeking females will be most useful for surveillance in the face of declining vector densities.

%! Antibody responses to repetitive epitopes of the circumsporozoite protein, liver stage antigen-1, and merozoite surface protein-2 in infants residing in a Plasmodium falciparum-hyperendemic area of western Kenya. XIII. Asembo Bay Cohort Project
%X The present study was initiated to characterize antibody responses to repetitive epitopes of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1), and merozoite surface protein-2 (MSP-2) of Plasmodium falciparum in infants residing in a P. falciparum-hyperendemic area of western Kenya. In this study, development and maintenance of these antibody responses in 28 infants were studied longitudinally by use of monthly serum samples collected from birth to age 1 year. Mother plasma and infant umbilical cord plasma were also tested to assess the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies. Results showed that antibodies passively transferred from mothers were detectable for CSP, LSA-1, and MSP-2 repeat epitopes. Infants were able to mount and maintain a strong antibody response against LSA-1 in their first year of life. Infants often responded to CSP repeats, but with a much lower antibody titer. Antibody responses in infants against Fc27 and 3D7 repeats of MSP-2 were low throughout their first year. In addition, 51 infants whose first detected infection occurred at > 4 months of age were selected to determine antibody responses to the antigens tested upon their first and second detected infections. Antibody responses to LSA-1 and, to a lesser degree, CSP increased in positivity rates and titer upon second infection. Antibody responses to Fc27-type and 3D7-type repeats of MSP-2 were low upon both infections. There was no association between maternally transferred anti-LSA-1, anti-CSP, or anti-MSP-2 antibodies and an infant's first detected infection. No significant correlation was found between an infant's antibody responses to the 4 antigen repetitive epitopes and protection against malarial parasitemia during the first year of life.
