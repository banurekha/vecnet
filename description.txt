# Description of the VecNet Digital Library System Diagram

The users interact with a Ruby on Rails application. The application mediates
all interaction between users and the data. It handles searching, browsing,
downloading the repository contents as well as the web based file ingest.

Solr is used for indexing the repository contents. We index item identifiers,
metadata, facet groupings, and, for the citation articles, full text. We are
indexing location names, but are not indexing geographic coordinates. Time
periods are not being indexed.

The Fedora Commons repository software  maintains the actual disk storage of
the repository contents. It is always accessed through the application.

A PostgreSQL database server supports the application and the Fedora repository
software. The application uses the database to store the MeSH subject
vocabulary terms, the NCBI species terms, and the geonames place name
hierarchy.

The application workers handle the background processing, such as unzipping
files, performing file characterization, and doing batch ingests.
